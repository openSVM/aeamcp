# $SVMAI Token: Utility and Tokenomics

## Overview

The $SVMAI token is the native utility token of the Solana AI Registries ecosystem, designed to facilitate value exchange, align incentives, and enable governance across the autonomous agent economy. This document outlines the token's purpose, utility mechanisms, and economic model.

## Core Token Utility

### 1. Registration Fees & Spam Prevention

**Mechanism**: A small amount of $SVMAI is required to register agents and MCP servers in the respective registries.

**Benefits**:
- Prevents spam registrations and ensures economic commitment
- Creates value capture from protocol usage
- Ensures registry quality through economic stake

**Implementation**:
- Base registration fee plus size-dependent component
- Fee reduction for longer-term commitments
- Potential partial refund upon proper deregistration

### 2. Protocol Governance

**Mechanism**: $SVMAI holders can vote on proposals affecting the protocol's development and parameters.

**Governance Rights Include**:
- Protocol upgrades and parameter adjustments
- Fee structure modifications
- Distribution of protocol treasury funds
- Approval of protocol integrations and partnerships

**Implementation**:
- Token-weighted voting with optional time-locking for increased weight
- On-chain governance through a DAO structure
- Proposal creation requires minimum token stake

### 3. Curation & Verification

**Mechanism**: $SVMAI tokens can be staked to endorse or validate registry entries.

**Benefits**:
- Enhanced discovery through quality signaling
- Incentivized community curation
- Risk-reward alignment through staking

**Implementation**:
- Curators stake tokens on registry entries they validate
- Rewards for accurate curation based on usage metrics
- Slashing for endorsing entries later proven malicious

### 4. Query Credits & API Access

**Mechanism**: $SVMAI tokens provide access to advanced querying and indexing services.

**Benefits**:
- Sustainable economics for off-chain indexers
- Fair access to premium discovery features
- Pay-as-you-go model for enterprise users

**Implementation**:
- Token-burning or time-locked staking for query credits
- Tiered access based on token holdings
- Integration with indexer service providers

### 5. Priority Processing

**Mechanism**: $SVMAI holders can stake tokens for priority processing of registry operations.

**Benefits**:
- Enhanced service levels for committed ecosystem participants
- Congestion management during high demand
- Value accrual for token holders

**Implementation**:
- Stake-to-weight priority queue for updates
- Dynamic pricing based on network congestion
- Token-burning option for urgent processing

## Economic Model

### Token Allocation & Circulation Status

The $SVMAI token was launched with 100% of the tokens already unlocked and in circulation. The token contract address is: `Cpzvdx6pppc9TNArsGsqgShCsKC9NCCjA2gtzHvUpump`

Key characteristics:
- **Total Supply**: Fixed supply as defined at launch
- **Circulation Status**: 100% of tokens already unlocked and in circulation
- **Initial Distribution**: Completed during token launch

### Token Utility Focus

With all tokens already in circulation, the $SVMAI token utility focuses on:

- **Ecosystem Participation**: Enabling participation in the protocol ecosystem
- **Governance Rights**: Providing voting power for protocol governance
- **Service Access**: Facilitating access to registry services
- **Future Revenue Sharing**: Potential for token holders to benefit from protocol revenue

### Value Capture Mechanisms

The $SVMAI token is designed with value capture mechanisms primarily focused on future revenue:

1. **Future Revenue Sharing**: Protocol revenue may be distributed to token holders in various forms
2. **Staking Opportunities**: Potential for staking-based rewards from future protocol revenue
3. **Governance-Driven Value**: Token holders can vote on revenue distribution models
4. **Utility-Driven Demand**: Increasing usage of the protocol drives demand for the utility functions of the token

## Token Integration with Protocol Components

### Agent Registry Integration

- **Registration Fee**: Paid in $SVMAI for new agent entries
- **Featured Listings**: Staking for enhanced visibility in discovery
- **Reputation Staking**: Token staking to back agent quality claims

### MCP Server Registry Integration

- **Registration Fee**: Paid in $SVMAI for new server entries
- **Tool Verification**: Staking to verify claimed tool capabilities
- **Service Level Guarantees**: Staking to back service level claims

### Off-Chain Indexer Network

- **Indexer Staking**: Operators stake tokens to participate in the indexing network
- **Query Payment**: Users pay tokens for advanced search capabilities
- **Data Freshness Guarantees**: Staking-based incentives for real-time indexing

## Protocol Revenue Distribution

Future revenue generated from the protocol may be distributed according to a model determined through governance, which could include:

- **Holder Benefits**: Direct or indirect benefits to token holders
- **Development Fund**: Allocation to ongoing protocol development
- **Treasury Building**: Building protocol reserves for sustainability
- **Community Programs**: Funding for ecosystem growth initiatives

The specific revenue distribution model will be determined through governance processes and may evolve as the protocol matures.

## Ecosystem Sustainability

The $SVMAI token model is designed for long-term sustainability through:

1. **Balanced Incentives**: Aligning all stakeholders toward ecosystem growth
2. **Counter-Cyclical Mechanisms**: Fee adjustments based on network usage and token value
3. **Governance-Led Adaptation**: Ability to evolve the model through community governance
4. **Multi-Stage Utility**: Different token utilities become prominent at different ecosystem maturity stages

## Cross-Protocol Interoperability

The $SVMAI token supports interoperability across multiple AI and blockchain protocols:

- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: Planned bridges to other blockchain ecosystems
- **AI Protocol Integration**: Token utility for integrated services from partner protocols
- **Composable Financial Primitives**: Integration with DeFi protocols for enhanced utility

## Regulatory Compliance

The $SVMAI token is designed with regulatory considerations in mind:

- **Utility Focus**: Primary focus on utility rather than speculative value
- **KYC Integration**: Optional KYC for certain governance functions
- **Transparent Reporting**: Regular updates on treasury management and token metrics
- **Legal Framework Compliance**: Adherence to emerging digital asset regulations

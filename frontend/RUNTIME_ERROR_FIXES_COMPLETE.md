# Runtime Error Fixes - Complete Resolution

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve runtime errors in the AEAMCP frontend application, specifically addressing IDL serialization issues and RPC connectivity problems.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. IDL Error: Type not found: undefined
**Problem**: The original error was `IdlError: Type not found: undefined` occurring during IDL serialization initialization.

**Root Cause**: The IDL files contained undefined type references and the serialization service was trying to initialize Borsh coders with invalid IDL definitions.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed IDL files to remove undefined types and ensure all type references are valid
- Updated serialization service to handle IDL initialization more safely
- Added proper error handling and validation for IDL deserialization

### 2. React Query Provider Missing
**Problem**: React Query hooks were being used without a QueryClient provider, causing runtime errors.

**Root Cause**: The application was using @tanstack/react-query hooks but didn't have the QueryClientProvider wrapper.

**Solution Applied**:
- Created `frontend/components/common/QueryProvider.tsx` as a client component
- Added QueryClientProvider with proper configuration to the app layout
- Wrapped the application with QueryProvider in the layout hierarchy

### 3. RPC Endpoint Configuration Issues
**Problem**: The RPC connection manager was configured with mainnet endpoints but the application needs devnet for testing.

**Root Cause**: Default endpoints were pointing to mainnet instead of devnet.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `frontend/lib/rpc/connection-manager.ts` to use devnet endpoints:
  - `https://api.devnet.solana.com` (priority 1)
  - `https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=demo` (priority 2)  
  - `https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet` (priority 3)

### 4. Primary Operation Failed Error
**Problem**: RPC service was failing with "Primary operation failed: {}" error.

**Root Cause**: Empty error objects were being logged when RPC operations failed, making debugging difficult.

**Solution Applied**:
- Improved error handling in the registry service
- Added better error logging and fallback mechanisms
- Updated RPC connection manager to handle endpoint failures more gracefully

## Files Modified

### Core Infrastructure
1. **frontend/components/common/QueryProvider.tsx** - NEW
   - React Query client provider component
   - Configured with appropriate defaults for caching and retry logic

2. **frontend/app/layout.tsx** - UPDATED
   - Added QueryProvider import and wrapper
   - Fixed JSX structure and provider hierarchy

3. **frontend/lib/rpc/connection-manager.ts** - UPDATED
   - Changed from mainnet to devnet endpoints
   - Updated endpoint priorities and configurations

### Serialization Fixes
4. **frontend/lib/solana/serialization.ts** - UPDATED
   - Improved IDL initialization safety
   - Added better error handling for undefined types
   - Enhanced deserialization validation

5. **frontend/lib/idl/agent_registry.json** - UPDATED
   - Fixed undefined type references
   - Ensured all type definitions are valid

6. **frontend/lib/idl/mcp_server_registry.json** - UPDATED
   - Fixed undefined type references
   - Cleaned up type definitions

### Service Layer
7. **frontend/lib/rpc/registry-service.ts** - REVIEWED
   - Verified error handling logic
   - Confirmed fallback mechanisms work properly

8. **frontend/lib/constants.ts** - REVIEWED
   - Confirmed devnet configuration is correct
   - Verified program IDs and endpoints

## Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Resolved Issues
- IDL serialization no longer throws "Type not found: undefined"
- React Query provider is properly configured and available
- RPC endpoints are correctly configured for devnet
- Application compiles and starts without critical errors

### üîÑ Ongoing Monitoring
- RPC connection health and performance
- IDL deserialization success rates
- Query caching effectiveness
- Error fallback mechanisms

## Development Server Status
The development server is now running successfully on port 3001 with:
- ‚úÖ All major compilation errors resolved
- ‚úÖ IDL serialization working correctly
- ‚úÖ React Query provider configured
- ‚úÖ RPC endpoints properly set for devnet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some pages may show empty states due to no deployed contracts on devnet yet

## Next Steps

### For Development
1. Deploy contracts to devnet to populate real data
2. Test all RPC operations with deployed contracts
3. Verify end-to-end functionality with real blockchain data

### For Production
1. Update RPC endpoints to mainnet when ready for production
2. Configure production-ready error monitoring
3. Implement proper logging and analytics

## Error Prevention Measures

### Added Safeguards
1. **IDL Validation**: Enhanced validation of IDL files before serialization
2. **Provider Hierarchy**: Proper React provider structure prevents hook errors
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple RPC endpoints with automatic failover
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user-friendly messages

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry) for production
2. Monitor RPC endpoint health and response times
3. Track IDL deserialization success/failure rates
4. Implement performance monitoring for React Query operations

## Configuration Summary

### React Query Configuration
```typescript
{
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
      retry: 2,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    },
  },
}
```

### RPC Endpoints (Devnet)
1. **Primary**: `https://api.devnet.solana.com`
2. **Secondary**: `https://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=demo`
3. **Tertiary**: `https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet`

### Program IDs (Devnet)
- **Agent Registry**: `BruRLHGfNaf6C5HKUqFu6md5ePJNELafm1vZdhctPkpr`
- **MCP Server Registry**: `BCBVehUHR3yhbDbvhV3QHS3s27k3LTbpX5CrXQ2sR2SR`

## Conclusion
All critical runtime errors have been resolved. The application now starts successfully and is ready for development and testing with deployed contracts on devnet. The error handling improvements will make debugging much easier going forward.

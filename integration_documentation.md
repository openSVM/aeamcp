# Website Integration Documentation

## Overview

This document details the integration of the comprehensive research document on "Solana Protocol Design for Agent and MCP Server Registries" into a standalone, book-like website that requires no server to function.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Single HTML File Approach

- Implemented client-side markdown parsing using marked.js from CDN
- Ensured all functionality works offline without requiring a server

### 2. Book-like Navigation

- Added a sidebar with chapter navigation
- Implemented previous/next chapter navigation buttons
- Added keyboard navigation support (left/right arrow keys)
- Included a table of contents that highlights the current chapter

### 3. Content Loading

- Set up dynamic loading of markdown files from the same directory
- Implemented proper error handling for missing files
- Added loading indicators for better user experience
- Preserved ASCII diagrams formatting with special styling

### 4. Responsive Design

- Ensured the layout works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Added a collapsible sidebar for mobile view
- Optimized text and diagram sizes for different screen sizes
- Implemented touch-friendly navigation controls

### 5. Additional Features

- Added PDF download functionality

### 6. 90s ASCII Grayscale Theme

- Maintained the monospace font throughout
- Used a grayscale color palette consistent with the original design
- Preserved sharp corners and simple borders for the 90s aesthetic
- Enhanced ASCII diagram display with proper formatting

## File Structure

The website requires the following files to be in the same directory:

1. `index.html` - The main HTML file containing all code and styling
2. `research_draft_part1.md` through `research_draft_part14.md` - The markdown content files
3. `solana_protocol_design_for_agent_and_mcp_server_registries.pdf` - The PDF version for download

## Usage Instructions

1. Place all files in the same directory
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Navigate between chapters using the sidebar or navigation buttons
4. Download the PDF version using the "Download PDF" button
5. Print the document using the "Print" button

## Browser Compatibility

The website has been optimized for:
- Chrome/Edge (latest versions)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android)

## Technical Implementation

- Used marked.js for markdown parsing
- Used Tailwind CSS for styling (via CDN)
- Implemented vanilla JavaScript for all functionality
- No server-side code or build process required

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding a search functionality
- Add support for dark mode
- Implement local storage to remember the last viewed chapter
- Add support for annotations or highlights

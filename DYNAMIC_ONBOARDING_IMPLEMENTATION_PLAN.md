## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Tour Engine (`components/onboarding/TourEngine.tsx`)
```typescript
interface TourEngineProps {
  tourId: string;
  userType: 'developer' | 'enduser' | 'provider';
  onComplete: (tourId: string) => void;
  onSkip: (step: number) => void;
}

export const TourEngine: React.FC<TourEngineProps> = ({
  tourId,
  userType,
  onComplete,
  onSkip
}) => {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0);
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(true);
  const tour = useTourConfig(tourId, userType);
  
  // Implementation details...
};
```

#### 2. Interactive Hotspot System (`components/onboarding/Hotspot.tsx`)
```typescript
interface HotspotProps {
  target: string; // CSS selector
  position: 'top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right' | 'center';
  content: React.ReactNode;
  action?: 'click' | 'hover' | 'scroll';
  onAction: () => void;
}

export const Hotspot: React.FC<HotspotProps> = ({
  target,
  position,
  content,
  action = 'click',
  onAction
}) => {
  // Positioning logic, overlay management, interaction handling
};
```

# Chapter 4: MCP Server Registry Protocol Design

## 4.1 Core Philosophy

### 4.1.1 Alignment with MCP Specification

The MCP Server Registry protocol is designed to align with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification, which defines standards for AI model interactions. The MCP specification provides a framework for consistent, interoperable communication between AI models and the applications that use them, focusing on context management, prompt engineering, and tool usage.

The core principles of the MCP specification that inform our registry design include:

1. **Standardized Interaction Patterns**: MCP defines consistent patterns for interacting with AI models, including request formats, response structures, and error handling. The registry must support the discovery of servers that implement these patterns.

2. **Context Management**: MCP emphasizes the importance of managing context in model interactions, including conversation history, user preferences, and system instructions. The registry must allow servers to advertise their context management capabilities.

3. **Tool Integration**: MCP enables models to use tools to extend their capabilities, such as web search, code execution, or data retrieval. The registry must provide mechanisms for servers to advertise their supported tools.

4. **Prompt Engineering**: MCP includes standards for prompt construction and management, allowing for consistent model behavior across implementations. The registry must support the discovery of servers based on their prompt engineering capabilities.

5. **Versioning and Compatibility**: MCP includes versioning to manage evolution while maintaining backward compatibility. The registry must track MCP version support for each server.

```

Our MCP Server Registry protocol translates these MCP principles into concrete design requirements:

1. **Protocol Version Tracking**: The registry tracks which MCP versions each server supports, enabling clients to find compatible servers.

2. **Tool Advertisement**: Servers can advertise the tools they support, allowing clients to discover servers with specific capabilities.

3. **Model Specification**: The registry includes fields for describing the underlying AI models, including their capabilities, limitations, and performance characteristics.

4. **Context Management Capabilities**: Servers can indicate their context management features, such as maximum context length, supported embeddings, and memory mechanisms.

5. **Operational Parameters**: The registry includes fields for operational details like rate limits, pricing, and usage policies.

6. **Discovery Mechanisms**: The registry is designed to support efficient discovery of servers based on various criteria, including supported tools, models, and operational parameters.

By aligning with the MCP specification, our MCP Server Registry protocol serves as a foundational infrastructure for a decentralized ecosystem of interoperable AI model servers, enabling clients to discover and interact with them in a consistent, standardized manner.

### 4.1.2 Server Discovery Mechanisms

Effective server discovery is a core objective of the MCP Server Registry protocol. The registry is designed to enable clients to find appropriate MCP servers based on their specific requirements, capabilities, and operational parameters.

The server discovery philosophy is built around several key principles:

1. **Capability-Based Discovery**: Clients should be able to discover servers based on their capabilities, such as supported tools, models, and features, rather than just by identity.

2. **Operational Parameter Matching**: Clients should be able to find servers that meet their operational requirements, such as availability, latency, rate limits, and pricing.

3. **Decentralized Discovery**: The discovery process should be decentralized, allowing any client to find servers without relying on centralized directories or gatekeepers.

4. **Verifiable Information**: The registry should provide verifiable information about servers, allowing clients to make informed decisions based on trustworthy data.

5. **Efficient Filtering**: The discovery process should support efficient filtering to narrow down the set of potential servers based on multiple criteria.

                                  +---------------------------+
                                  |                           |
                                  |  Filtered Server List     |
                                  |                           |
                                  |  - Compatible servers     |
                                  |  - Ranked by relevance    |
                                  |  - With connection info   |
                                  |                           |
                                  +---------------------------+
```

The registry implements these principles through a combination of on-chain data structures and off-chain indexing:

1. **Capability Flags**: A bitfield representing the server's core capabilities, allowing for efficient filtering.

2. **Tool Registry**: A list of supported tools with their specifications, enabling tool-based discovery.

3. **Model Metadata**: Detailed information about the underlying models, including their capabilities and limitations.

4. **Operational Metadata**: Information about the server's operational parameters, such as availability, rate limits, and pricing.

5. **Service Endpoints**: Connection details for different interaction protocols, enabling clients to connect to discovered servers.

The discovery process typically involves several steps:

1. **Initial Filtering**: Clients filter the registry based on essential requirements, such as required tools or model capabilities.

2. **Refinement**: Clients further refine the list based on operational parameters, such as availability, latency, or pricing.

3. **Verification**: Clients verify the server's claims through reputation systems, cryptographic proofs, or direct testing.

4. **Connection**: Clients connect to selected servers using the provided service endpoints.

This discovery mechanism enables a dynamic, market-driven ecosystem of MCP servers, where clients can find the most appropriate servers for their specific needs, and servers can differentiate themselves based on their unique capabilities and operational characteristics.

## 4.2 Data Specification for MCP Server Entry PDA

### 4.2.1 MCPServerRegistryEntryV1 Structure

The `MCPServerRegistryEntryV1` structure defines the on-chain data stored in each MCP server registry entry PDA. This structure is designed to provide comprehensive information about MCP servers while optimizing for on-chain storage efficiency.

```rust

    pub bump: u8,                     // For PDA reconstruction
    pub registry_version: u8,         // Schema version for upgradability
    pub owner_authority: Pubkey,      // 32 bytes, owner's public key
    pub status: u8,                   // Active, inactive, etc.

}

#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct ModelInfo {
    pub model_id: String,             // Model identifier, max 64 chars
    pub display_name: String,         // Human-readable name, max 128 chars

    pub context_window: u32,          // Context window size in tokens
    pub max_output_tokens: u32,       // Maximum output tokens
    pub description_hash: Option<[u8; 32]>,  // SHA-256 hash of detailed description
}

#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct ToolInfo {
    pub tool_id: String,              // Tool identifier, max 64 chars
    pub name: String,                 // Human-readable name, max 128 chars
    pub description: String,          // Brief description, max 256 chars
    pub version: String,              // Tool version, max 32 chars
    pub schema_hash: [u8; 32],        // SHA-256 hash of the tool's schema
    pub schema_uri: String,           // URI to the tool's schema, max 256 chars
}

#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct ServiceEndpoint {
    pub protocol: String,             // Protocol type, max 64 chars
    pub url: String,                  // Endpoint URL, max 256 chars
    pub is_default: bool,             // Whether this is the primary endpoint
}
```

This structure is organized to optimize for both storage efficiency and access patterns:

1. **Fixed-size fields first**: The structure begins with fixed-size fields like integers, booleans, and public keys, which are easy to access and update.

2. **Progressive complexity**: It progresses from simple scalar fields to more complex structures like vectors and nested objects.

3. **Size constraints**: Each variable-length field has a defined maximum size to prevent excessive storage usage.

4. **Optional fields**: Less essential information is stored in `Option` types, allowing entries to include only the fields relevant to them.

5. **Hybrid storage model**: For potentially large data elements like detailed model descriptions or tool schemas, only hashes are stored on-chain, with the full content available off-chain.

The structure also includes an `extended_metadata_uri` field, which can point to a more comprehensive off-chain metadata document stored on IPFS, Arweave, or another decentralized storage system.

These field definitions and constraints ensure that MCP server registry entries are comprehensive, consistent, and efficient in their use of on-chain storage.

### 4.2.3 Tool and Resource Advertisement

A key function of the MCP Server Registry is to advertise the tools and resources that each server provides. This advertisement mechanism allows clients to discover servers that support the specific tools they need for their applications.

**Tool Advertisement Model:**

The registry implements a comprehensive tool advertisement model that includes:

1. **Tool Identification**: Each tool has a unique identifier (`tool_id`) that distinguishes it within the server's toolset.

2. **Tool Metadata**: Basic information about each tool, including its name, description, and version.

3. **Tool Schema**: A reference to the tool's schema, which defines its inputs, outputs, and behavior. The schema is stored off-chain, with its hash stored on-chain for verification.

4. **Tool Categories**: Tools can be categorized by type or domain, allowing for more efficient discovery.

|  |                     |  |
|  +---------------------+  |
|                           |
+---------------------------+
```

**Tool Schema Format:**

Tool schemas are typically defined using OpenAPI (for HTTP-based tools) or JSON Schema (for function-calling tools). These schemas define:

1. **Input Parameters**: The parameters that the tool accepts, including their names, types, descriptions, and constraints.

2. **Output Format**: The structure of the data returned by the tool.

3. **Error Handling**: The possible error codes and their meanings.

4. **Authentication Requirements**: Any authentication or authorization required to use the tool.

Here's an example of a simplified tool schema for a weather information tool:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "info": {
    "title": "Weather Information Tool",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Provides current weather and forecasts for locations worldwide"
  },
  "paths": {
    "/current": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Get current weather",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "location",
            "in": "query",
            "required": true,
            "schema": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "description": "City name or coordinates"
          },
          {
            "name": "units",
            "in": "query",
            "required": false,
            "schema": {
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["metric", "imperial"],
              "default": "metric"
            },
            "description": "Unit system for temperature and wind speed"
          }
        ],
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "Successful response",
            "content": {
              "application/json": {
                "schema": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "temperature": {
                      "type": "number"
                    },
                    "conditions": {
                      "type": "string"
                    },
                    "humidity": {
                      "type": "number"
                    },
                    "wind_speed": {
                      "type": "number"
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          },
          "400": {
            "description": "Invalid location"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This schema would be stored off-chain (e.g., on IPFS), with its hash stored in the `schema_hash` field of the corresponding `ToolInfo` structure.

**Standard vs. Custom Tools:**

The MCP Server Registry distinguishes between two types of tools:

1. **Standard Tools**: Tools that follow widely adopted specifications and are implemented consistently across multiple servers. These tools have well-known `tool_id` values and standardized schemas.

2. **Custom Tools**: Server-specific tools that provide unique functionality. These tools have server-specific `tool_id` values and custom schemas.

The `CUSTOM_TOOLS` capability flag in the server's `capabilities_flags` indicates whether the server supports custom tools beyond the standard set.

**Resource Advertisement:**

Beyond tools, MCP servers may also advertise other resources they provide:

1. **Models**: The AI models available on the server, including their capabilities, context windows, and output limits.

2. **Embeddings**: Embedding models for converting text or other data into vector representations.

3. **Fine-tuning Capabilities**: Whether and how the server supports fine-tuning of models on custom datasets.

4. **Specialized Functionalities**: Domain-specific capabilities like code generation, mathematical reasoning, or creative writing.

These resources are advertised through the `models` field and the server's `capabilities_flags`.

**Implementation Considerations:**

When implementing tool and resource advertisement in the MCP Server Registry, several considerations should be kept in mind:

1. **Schema Versioning**: Tool schemas should include version information to manage evolution while maintaining backward compatibility.

2. **Schema Size Limitations**: Since tool schemas are stored off-chain, they can be comprehensive, but care should be taken to keep them reasonably sized for efficient retrieval.

3. **Schema Verification**: Clients should verify the integrity of retrieved schemas by comparing their hash with the `schema_hash` stored on-chain.

4. **Tool Discovery**: The registry should support efficient discovery of servers based on the tools they provide, potentially through secondary indexes or off-chain indexing.

5. **Tool Compatibility**: Servers should clearly indicate which models support which tools, as not all tools may be compatible with all models.

By implementing a comprehensive tool and resource advertisement mechanism, the MCP Server Registry enables clients to discover servers that provide the specific capabilities they need, fostering a rich ecosystem of specialized AI services.

## 4.3 Program Instructions for MCP Server Registry

### 4.3.1 Registration Process

The registration process for MCP servers follows a similar pattern to the Agent Registry, with adaptations specific to the MCP server context. This process creates a new PDA account to store the server's metadata and establishes the server's identity on-chain.

**Instruction Definition:**

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(args: RegisterMCPServerArgs)]
pub struct RegisterMCPServer<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = payer,
        space = 8 + MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::SPACE,
        seeds = [
            b"mcp_server_registry",
            args.server_id.as_bytes(),
            owner_authority.key().as_ref(),
        ],
        bump
    )]
    pub entry: Account<'info, MCPServerRegistryEntryV1>,
    
    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,
    
    pub owner_authority: Signer<'info>,
    
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct RegisterMCPServerArgs {
    pub server_id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub server_version: String,
    pub supported_mcp_versions: Vec<String>,
    pub max_context_length: u32,
    pub max_token_limit: u32,
    pub models: Vec<ModelInfoArgs>,
    pub supported_tools: Vec<ToolInfoArgs>,
    pub provider_name: Option<String>,
    pub provider_url: Option<String>,
    pub documentation_url: Option<String>,
    pub security_info_uri: Option<String>,
    pub rate_limit_requests: Option<u32>,
    pub rate_limit_tokens: Option<u32>,
    pub pricing_info_uri: Option<String>,
    pub service_endpoints: Vec<ServiceEndpoint>,
    pub capabilities_flags: u64,
    pub extended_metadata_uri: Option<String>,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct ModelInfoArgs {
    pub model_id: String,
    pub display_name: String,
    pub model_type: String,
    pub capabilities_flags: u64,
    pub context_window: u32,
    pub max_output_tokens: u32,
    pub description_hash: Option<[u8; 32]>,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct ToolInfoArgs {
    pub tool_id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub version: String,
    pub schema_hash: [u8; 32],
    pub schema_uri: String,
}
```

**Registration Flow:**

1. **Input Validation**: The instruction first validates all input parameters to ensure they meet the defined constraints:

```rust
pub fn register_mcp_server(ctx: Context<RegisterMCPServer>, args: RegisterMCPServerArgs) -> Result<()> {
    // Validate string lengths
    require!(
        args.server_id.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_SERVER_ID_LEN,
        ErrorCode::StringTooLong
    );
    require!(
        args.name.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_NAME_LEN,
        ErrorCode::StringTooLong
    );
    // Additional validations...
    
    // Validate collection sizes
    require!(
        args.supported_mcp_versions.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_MCP_VERSIONS,
        ErrorCode::TooManyItems
    );
    require!(
        args.models.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_MODELS,
        ErrorCode::TooManyItems
    );
    require!(
        args.supported_tools.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_TOOLS,
        ErrorCode::TooManyItems
    );
    require!(
        args.service_endpoints.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_ENDPOINTS,
        ErrorCode::TooManyItems
    );
    
    // Validate server_id format (e.g., alphanumeric with hyphens)
    require!(
        args.server_id.chars().all(|c| c.is_alphanumeric() || c == '-'),
        ErrorCode::InvalidServerId
    );
    
    // Ensure at least one service endpoint is marked as default
    require!(
        args.service_endpoints.iter().any(|ep| ep.is_default),
        ErrorCode::NoDefaultEndpoint
    );
    
    // Validate MCP versions format
    for version in &args.supported_mcp_versions {
        require!(
            is_valid_mcp_version(version),
            ErrorCode::InvalidMCPVersion
        );
    }
    
    // Continue with registration...
}

fn is_valid_mcp_version(version: &str) -> bool {
    // Check if the version follows the YYYY-MM-DD format
    if version.len() != 10 {
        return false;
    }
    
    let parts: Vec<&str> = version.split('-').collect();
    if parts.len() != 3 {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check year (2020 or later)
    if let Ok(year) = parts[0].parse::<u16>() {
        if year < 2020 {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check month (01-12)
    if let Ok(month) = parts[1].parse::<u8>() {
        if month < 1 || month > 12 {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check day (01-31)
    if let Ok(day) = parts[2].parse::<u8>() {
        if day < 1 || day > 31 {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        return false;
    }
    
    true
}
```

2. **Account Initialization**: The Anchor framework automatically initializes the PDA account based on the `init` constraint, allocating space and transferring the rent exemption amount from the payer.

3. **Data Population**: The instruction populates the account with the provided data:

```rust
pub fn register_mcp_server(ctx: Context<RegisterMCPServer>, args: RegisterMCPServerArgs) -> Result<()> {
    // Validation code...
    
    let entry = &mut ctx.accounts.entry;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    
    // Initialize metadata and control fields
    entry.bump = *ctx.bumps.get("entry").unwrap();
    entry.registry_version = 1;
    entry.owner_authority = ctx.accounts.owner_authority.key();
    entry.status = ServerStatus::Active as u8;
    entry.capabilities_flags = args.capabilities_flags;
    entry.created_at = clock.unix_timestamp;
    entry.updated_at = clock.unix_timestamp;
    
    // Initialize identity fields
    entry.server_id = args.server_id;
    entry.name = args.name;
    entry.server_version = args.server_version;
    
    // Initialize MCP-specific fields
    entry.supported_mcp_versions = args.supported_mcp_versions;
    entry.max_context_length = args.max_context_length;
    entry.max_token_limit = args.max_token_limit;
    
    // Initialize description
    entry.description = args.description;
    
    // Initialize models
    entry.models = args.models.iter().map(|model_arg| ModelInfo {
        model_id: model_arg.model_id.clone(),
        display_name: model_arg.display_name.clone(),
        model_type: model_arg.model_type.clone(),
        capabilities_flags: model_arg.capabilities_flags,
        context_window: model_arg.context_window,
        max_output_tokens: model_arg.max_output_tokens,
        description_hash: model_arg.description_hash,
    }).collect();
    
    // Initialize tools
    entry.supported_tools = args.supported_tools.iter().map(|tool_arg| ToolInfo {
        tool_id: tool_arg.tool_id.clone(),
        name: tool_arg.name.clone(),
        description: tool_arg.description.clone(),
        version: tool_arg.version.clone(),
        schema_hash: tool_arg.schema_hash,
        schema_uri: tool_arg.schema_uri.clone(),
    }).collect();
    
    // Initialize optional fields
    entry.provider_name = args.provider_name;
    entry.provider_url = args.provider_url;
    entry.documentation_url = args.documentation_url;
    entry.security_info_uri = args.security_info_uri;
    
    // Initialize operational parameters
    entry.rate_limit_requests = args.rate_limit_requests;
    entry.rate_limit_tokens = args.rate_limit_tokens;
    entry.pricing_info_uri = args.pricing_info_uri;
    
    // Initialize service endpoints
    entry.service_endpoints = args.service_endpoints;
    
    // Initialize extended metadata URI
    entry.extended_metadata_uri = args.extended_metadata_uri;
    
    // Emit event for indexers
    emit!(MCPServerRegisteredEvent {
        server_id: entry.server_id.clone(),
        owner: entry.owner_authority,
        timestamp: entry.created_at,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}
```

4. **Event Emission**: The instruction emits an event to notify off-chain indexers of the new registration:

```rust
#[event]
pub struct MCPServerRegisteredEvent {
    pub server_id: String,
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

**Security Considerations:**

1. **Signer Verification**: Both the payer (who funds the account creation) and the owner authority (who will control the entry) must sign the transaction.

2. **PDA Derivation**: The PDA is derived from the server ID and owner authority, ensuring that each owner can only register one server with a given ID.

3. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated to prevent malicious data from being stored on-chain.

4. **Schema Hash Verification**: While the registry doesn't verify the content of tool schemas (which are stored off-chain), it does store their hashes, allowing clients to verify the integrity of the schemas they retrieve.

**Client Integration:**

From a client perspective, registering an MCP server involves preparing the registration arguments, deriving the expected PDA, and submitting the transaction:

```typescript
async function registerMCPServer(
    program: Program<MCPServerRegistry>,
    args: RegisterMCPServerArgs,
    ownerKeypair: Keypair,
    payerKeypair: Keypair
): Promise<PublicKey> {
    // Derive the PDA for the server entry
    const [entryPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
        [
            Buffer.from("mcp_server_registry"),
            Buffer.from(args.server_id),
            ownerKeypair.publicKey.toBuffer()
        ],
        program.programId
    );
    
    // Submit the transaction
    await program.methods
        .registerMCPServer(args)
        .accounts({
            entry: entryPda,
            payer: payerKeypair.publicKey,
            ownerAuthority: ownerKeypair.publicKey,
            systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
        })
        .signers([payerKeypair, ownerKeypair])
        .rpc();
    
    return entryPda;
}
```

The registration process establishes the server's presence in the registry, making it discoverable by clients and other servers. It represents the first step in the server's lifecycle within the ecosystem.

### 4.3.2 Update Mechanisms

After an MCP server is registered, its information may need to be updated to reflect changes in capabilities, models, tools, or other metadata. The MCP Server Registry protocol provides several update mechanisms to accommodate different update scenarios while maintaining security and efficiency.

**Full Update Instruction:**

The full update instruction allows comprehensive updates to a server's metadata:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(args: UpdateMCPServerArgs)]
pub struct UpdateMCPServer<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [
            b"mcp_server_registry",
            entry.server_id.as_bytes(),
            owner_authority.key().as_ref(),
        ],
        bump = entry.bump,
        has_one = owner_authority @ ErrorCode::Unauthorized
    )]
    pub entry: Account<'info, MCPServerRegistryEntryV1>,
    
    pub owner_authority: Signer<'info>,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct UpdateMCPServerArgs {
    pub name: Option<String>,
    pub description: Option<String>,
    pub server_version: Option<String>,
    pub supported_mcp_versions: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub max_context_length: Option<u32>,
    pub max_token_limit: Option<u32>,
    pub models: Option<Vec<ModelInfoArgs>>,
    pub supported_tools: Option<Vec<ToolInfoArgs>>,
    pub provider_name: Option<Option<String>>,
    pub provider_url: Option<Option<String>>,
    pub documentation_url: Option<Option<String>>,
    pub security_info_uri: Option<Option<String>>,
    pub rate_limit_requests: Option<Option<u32>>,
    pub rate_limit_tokens: Option<Option<u32>>,
    pub pricing_info_uri: Option<Option<String>>,
    pub service_endpoints: Option<Vec<ServiceEndpoint>>,
    pub capabilities_flags: Option<u64>,
    pub extended_metadata_uri: Option<Option<String>>,
}
```

The update instruction processes only the fields that are provided, leaving others unchanged:

```rust
pub fn update_mcp_server(ctx: Context<UpdateMCPServer>, args: UpdateMCPServerArgs) -> Result<()> {
    let entry = &mut ctx.accounts.entry;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    
    // Track which fields were updated for the event
    let mut updated_fields = Vec::new();
    
    // Update fields if provided
    if let Some(name) = args.name {
        require!(
            name.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_NAME_LEN,
            ErrorCode::StringTooLong
        );
        entry.name = name;
        updated_fields.push("name".to_string());
    }
    
    if let Some(description) = args.description {
        require!(
            description.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_DESCRIPTION_LEN,
            ErrorCode::StringTooLong
        );
        entry.description = description;
        updated_fields.push("description".to_string());
    }
    
    if let Some(server_version) = args.server_version {
        require!(
            server_version.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_VERSION_LEN,
            ErrorCode::StringTooLong
        );
        entry.server_version = server_version;
        updated_fields.push("server_version".to_string());
    }
    
    if let Some(supported_mcp_versions) = args.supported_mcp_versions {
        require!(
            supported_mcp_versions.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_MCP_VERSIONS,
            ErrorCode::TooManyItems
        );
        
        // Validate MCP versions format
        for version in &supported_mcp_versions {
            require!(
                is_valid_mcp_version(version),
                ErrorCode::InvalidMCPVersion
            );
        }
        
        entry.supported_mcp_versions = supported_mcp_versions;
        updated_fields.push("supported_mcp_versions".to_string());
    }
    
    // Additional field updates...
    
    // Update timestamp
    entry.updated_at = clock.unix_timestamp;
    
    // Emit event for indexers
    emit!(MCPServerUpdatedEvent {
        server_id: entry.server_id.clone(),
        owner: entry.owner_authority,
        updated_fields,
        timestamp: entry.updated_at,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**Targeted Update Instructions:**

For common update scenarios, the protocol provides targeted instructions that focus on specific aspects of the server's metadata:

1. **Update Status Instruction:**

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct UpdateMCPServerStatus<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [
            b"mcp_server_registry",
            entry.server_id.as_bytes(),
            owner_authority.key().as_ref(),
        ],
        bump = entry.bump,
        has_one = owner_authority @ ErrorCode::Unauthorized
    )]
    pub entry: Account<'info, MCPServerRegistryEntryV1>,
    
    pub owner_authority: Signer<'info>,
}

pub fn update_mcp_server_status(ctx: Context<UpdateMCPServerStatus>, new_status: u8) -> Result<()> {
    require!(
        new_status <= ServerStatus::Deprecated as u8,
        ErrorCode::InvalidStatus
    );
    
    let entry = &mut ctx.accounts.entry;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    
    // Update status
    entry.status = new_status;
    entry.updated_at = clock.unix_timestamp;
    
    // Emit event for indexers
    emit!(MCPServerStatusChangedEvent {
        server_id: entry.server_id.clone(),
        owner: entry.owner_authority,
        new_status,
        timestamp: entry.updated_at,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}
```

2. **Update Models Instruction:**

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct UpdateMCPServerModels<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [
            b"mcp_server_registry",
            entry.server_id.as_bytes(),
            owner_authority.key().as_ref(),
        ],
        bump = entry.bump,
        has_one = owner_authority @ ErrorCode::Unauthorized
    )]
    pub entry: Account<'info, MCPServerRegistryEntryV1>,
    
    pub owner_authority: Signer<'info>,
}

pub fn update_mcp_server_models(
    ctx: Context<UpdateMCPServerModels>,
    models: Vec<ModelInfoArgs>
) -> Result<()> {
    require!(
        models.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_MODELS,
        ErrorCode::TooManyItems
    );
    
    let entry = &mut ctx.accounts.entry;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    
    // Update models
    entry.models = models.iter().map(|model_arg| ModelInfo {
        model_id: model_arg.model_id.clone(),
        display_name: model_arg.display_name.clone(),
        model_type: model_arg.model_type.clone(),
        capabilities_flags: model_arg.capabilities_flags,
        context_window: model_arg.context_window,
        max_output_tokens: model_arg.max_output_tokens,
        description_hash: model_arg.description_hash,
    }).collect();
    
    entry.updated_at = clock.unix_timestamp;
    
    // Emit event for indexers
    emit!(MCPServerModelsUpdatedEvent {
        server_id: entry.server_id.clone(),
        owner: entry.owner_authority,
        timestamp: entry.updated_at,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}
```

3. **Update Tools Instruction:**

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct UpdateMCPServerTools<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [
            b"mcp_server_registry",
            entry.server_id.as_bytes(),
            owner_authority.key().as_ref(),
        ],
        bump = entry.bump,
        has_one = owner_authority @ ErrorCode::Unauthorized
    )]
    pub entry: Account<'info, MCPServerRegistryEntryV1>,
    
    pub owner_authority: Signer<'info>,
}

pub fn update_mcp_server_tools(
    ctx: Context<UpdateMCPServerTools>,
    tools: Vec<ToolInfoArgs>
) -> Result<()> {
    require!(
        tools.len() <= MCPServerRegistryEntryV1::MAX_TOOLS,
        ErrorCode::TooManyItems
    );
    
    let entry = &mut ctx.accounts.entry;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    
    // Update tools
    entry.supported_tools = tools.iter().map(|tool_arg| ToolInfo {
        tool_id: tool_arg.tool_id.clone(),
        name: tool_arg.name.clone(),
        description: tool_arg.description.clone(),
        version: tool_arg.version.clone(),
        schema_hash: tool_arg.schema_hash,
        schema_uri: tool_arg.schema_uri.clone(),
    }).collect();
    
    entry.updated_at = clock.unix_timestamp;
    
    // Emit event for indexers
    emit!(MCPServerToolsUpdatedEvent {
        server_id: entry.server_id.clone(),
        owner: entry.owner_authority,
        timestamp: entry.updated_at,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**Update Event Emission:**

Each update instruction emits an appropriate event to notify off-chain indexers of the changes:

```rust
#[event]
pub struct MCPServerUpdatedEvent {
    pub server_id: String,
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub updated_fields: Vec<String>,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}

#[event]
pub struct MCPServerStatusChangedEvent {
    pub server_id: String,
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub new_status: u8,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}

#[event]
pub struct MCPServerModelsUpdatedEvent {
    pub server_id: String,
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}

#[event]
pub struct MCPServerToolsUpdatedEvent {
    pub server_id: String,
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

**Security Considerations:**

1. **Owner Verification**: All update instructions verify that the transaction is signed by the owner authority recorded in the entry.

2. **Input Validation**: All updates are validated to ensure they meet the defined constraints.

3. **Partial Updates**: The full update instruction allows updating only specific fields, reducing the risk of unintended changes.

4. **Timestamp Tracking**: Each update records the current timestamp, providing an audit trail of changes.

**Client Integration:**

From a client perspective, updating an MCP server involves preparing the update arguments and submitting the appropriate instruction:

```typescript
async function updateMCPServerStatus(
    program: Program<MCPServerRegistry>,
    serverId: string,
    newStatus: number,
    ownerKeypair: Keypair
): Promise<void> {
    // Derive the PDA for the server entry
    const [entryPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
        [
            Buffer.from("mcp_server_registry"),
            Buffer.from(serverId),
            ownerKeypair.publicKey.toBuffer()
        ],
        program.programId
    );
    
    // Submit the transaction
    await program.methods
        .updateMCPServerStatus(newStatus)
        .accounts({
            entry: entryPda,
            ownerAuthority: ownerKeypair.publicKey,
        })
        .signers([ownerKeypair])
        .rpc();
}
```

These update mechanisms provide flexibility for server operators to maintain their registry entries throughout their lifecycle, ensuring that the registry remains an accurate and up-to-date source of MCP server metadata.

### 4.3.3 Deregistration and Cleanup

The final stage in an MCP server's lifecycle within the registry is deregistration, which can occur when a server is deprecated, replaced, or no longer needed. The MCP Server Registry protocol provides two approaches to deregistration: status-based deactivation and complete account closure.

**Status-Based Deactivation:**

The simplest form of deregistration is to update the server's status to `Inactive` or `Deprecated` using the `update_mcp_server_status` instruction described in the previous section:

```rust
pub fn deactivate_mcp_server(ctx: Context<UpdateMCPServerStatus>) -> Result<()> {
    let entry = &mut ctx.accounts.entry;
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    
    // Mark as inactive
    entry.status = ServerStatus::Inactive as u8;
    entry.updated_at = clock.unix_timestamp;
    
    // Emit event for indexers
    emit!(MCPServerStatusChangedEvent {
        server_id: entry.server_id.clone(),
        owner: entry.owner_authority,
        new_status: entry.status,
        timestamp: entry.updated_at,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}
```

This approach maintains the server's entry in the registry but signals that it is no longer active. It's suitable for temporary deactivations or when preserving the server's history is important.

**Complete Account Closure:**

For permanent deregistration, the protocol provides an instruction to close the server's account and reclaim its rent exemption:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CloseMCPServerEntry<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [
            b"mcp_server_registry",
            entry.server_id.as_bytes(),
            owner_authority.key().as_ref(),
        ],
        bump = entry.bump,
        has_one = owner_authority @ ErrorCode::Unauthorized,
        close = recipient  // Close the account and send lamports to recipient
    )]
    pub entry: Account<'info, MCPServerRegistryEntryV1>,
    
    pub owner_authority: Signer<'info>,
    
    #[account(mut)]
    pub recipient: SystemAccount<'info>,
}

pub fn close_mcp_server_entry(ctx: Context<CloseMCPServerEntry>) -> Result<()> {
    let entry = &ctx.accounts.entry;
    
    // Emit event for indexers before account is closed
    emit!(MCPServerRemovedEvent {
        server_id: entry.server_id.clone(),
        owner: entry.owner_authority,
        timestamp: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
    });
    
    // Account will be automatically closed by Anchor
    Ok(())
}
```

This instruction performs several operations:

1. **Verification**: It verifies that the transaction is signed by the owner authority.

2. **Event Emission**: It emits an event to notify off-chain indexers of the removal.

3. **Account Closure**: It closes the account and transfers its lamports to the specified recipient.

The `close` constraint in Anchor automatically handles the account closure and lamport transfer, simplifying the implementation.

**Deregistration Event:**

The deregistration process emits an event to notify off-chain indexers:

```rust
#[event]
pub struct MCPServerRemovedEvent {
    pub server_id: String,
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

This event allows indexers to update their databases to reflect the server's removal from the registry.

**Security Considerations:**

1. **Owner Verification**: The deregistration instruction verifies that the transaction is signed by the owner authority recorded in the entry.

2. **Recipient Specification**: The recipient of the reclaimed lamports must be explicitly specified, preventing accidental loss of funds.

3. **Event Emission**: The event is emitted before the account is closed, ensuring that indexers receive notification of the removal.

**Client Integration:**

From a client perspective, closing an MCP server entry involves specifying the recipient for the reclaimed lamports and submitting the instruction:

```typescript
async function closeMCPServerEntry(
    program: Program<MCPServerRegistry>,
    serverId: string,
    ownerKeypair: Keypair,
    recipientAddress: PublicKey
): Promise<void> {
    // Derive the PDA for the server entry
    const [entryPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
        [
            Buffer.from("mcp_server_registry"),
            Buffer.from(serverId),
            ownerKeypair.publicKey.toBuffer()
        ],
        program.programId
    );
    
    // Submit the transaction
    await program.methods
        .closeMCPServerEntry()
        .accounts({
            entry: entryPda,
            ownerAuthority: ownerKeypair.publicKey,
            recipient: recipientAddress,
        })
        .signers([ownerKeypair])
        .rpc();
}
```

**Deregistration Strategy:**

The choice between status-based deactivation and complete account closure depends on several factors:

1. **Permanence**: If the deregistration is permanent, account closure is more appropriate. If it might be temporary, status-based deactivation is better.

2. **Resource Recovery**: Account closure allows recovering the rent exemption, which can be significant for large entries.

3. **Historical Record**: Status-based deactivation preserves the server's entry for historical reference, while account closure removes it entirely.

4. **Reuse Potential**: If the server ID might be reused in the future, status-based deactivation maintains the PDA, simplifying reactivation.

The MCP Server Registry protocol supports both approaches, giving server operators flexibility in managing their servers' lifecycle.

## 4.4 Verification and Trust Models

### 4.4.1 Server Capability Verification

Verifying that MCP servers actually possess the capabilities they claim is a critical aspect of the registry's trust model. The registry protocol includes several mechanisms to support capability verification:

**On-Chain Capability Claims:**

The registry stores several types of capability claims on-chain:

1. **Capability Flags**: Bitfields indicating the server's core capabilities, such as streaming, function calling, or vision.

2. **Model Specifications**: Details about the models supported by the server, including their context windows and output limits.

3. **Tool Advertisements**: Information about the tools supported by the server, including their schemas.

These claims form the basis for capability verification, but they need to be validated through additional mechanisms.

**Verification Mechanisms:**

The registry supports several verification mechanisms:

1. **Schema Hash Verification**: For tools, the registry stores the hash of the tool's schema. Clients can verify that the schema they retrieve from the off-chain URI matches this hash, ensuring the integrity of the schema.

```typescript
async function verifyToolSchema(
    program: Program<MCPServerRegistry>,
    serverId: string,
    toolId: string,
    ownerPublicKey: PublicKey
): Promise<boolean> {
    // Derive the PDA for the server entry
    const [entryPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
        [
            Buffer.from("mcp_server_registry"),
            Buffer.from(serverId),
            ownerPublicKey.toBuffer()
        ],
        program.programId
    );
    
    // Fetch the server entry
    const entry = await program.account.mcpServerRegistryEntryV1.fetch(entryPda);
    
    // Find the tool
    const tool = entry.supportedTools.find(t => t.toolId === toolId);
    if (!tool) {
        throw new Error(`Tool ${toolId} not found`);
    }
    
    // Fetch the schema from the URI
    const schemaResponse = await fetch(tool.schemaUri);
    const schemaText = await schemaResponse.text();
    
    // Compute the hash of the schema
    const schemaHash = sha256(schemaText);
    
    // Compare with the stored hash
    return arrayEquals(schemaHash, tool.schemaHash);
}
```

2. **Challenge-Response Verification**: Clients can send challenge requests to servers to verify their capabilities. For example, a client might request a server to generate a response using a specific model or tool.

```typescript
async function verifyServerCapability(
    serverEndpoint: string,
    capability: string,
    challenge: any
): Promise<boolean> {
    try {
        // Send a challenge request to the server
        const response = await fetch(`${serverEndpoint}/verify/${capability}`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ challenge }),
        });
        
        if (!response.ok) {
            return false;
        }
        
        const result = await response.json();
        
        // Verify the response based on the capability
        switch (capability) {
            case 'function_calling':
                return result.function_call && result.function_call.name === challenge.expected_function;
            case 'vision':
                return result.content && result.content.includes(challenge.expected_content);
            // Other capability verifications...
            default:
                return false;
        }
    } catch (error) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

3. **Attestation Services**: Third-party attestation services can verify server capabilities and provide cryptographic attestations that can be referenced in the registry.

                                  +---------------------------+
```

4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Standardized benchmarks can be run against servers to verify their performance characteristics, with results stored off-chain and referenced in the registry.

**Implementation Considerations:**

When implementing capability verification in the MCP Server Registry, several considerations should be kept in mind:

1. **Verification Freshness**: Capabilities may change over time, so verification should be periodically refreshed.

2. **Verification Granularity**: Different capabilities may require different verification mechanisms and frequencies.

3. **Verification Cost**: Some verification methods may be resource-intensive, so a balance must be struck between thoroughness and efficiency.

4. **Verification Transparency**: The verification process should be transparent, with clear criteria and results.

By implementing robust capability verification mechanisms, the MCP Server Registry can provide clients with confidence that servers actually possess the capabilities they claim, enhancing the trustworthiness of the ecosystem.

### 4.4.2 Trust Establishment Mechanisms

Trust is a fundamental requirement for the MCP Server Registry ecosystem. Clients need to trust that servers will behave as expected, respect their data, and provide reliable service. The registry protocol includes several mechanisms to establish and maintain trust:

**Identity Verification:**

The first level of trust is established through identity verification:

1. **On-Chain Ownership**: The registry records the owner authority of each server entry, which is the Solana public key that controls the entry. This provides a cryptographic binding between the server and its controller.

2. **Provider Information**: The registry includes fields for provider name and URL, allowing clients to research the entity behind the server.

3. **Documentation Links**: The registry includes links to documentation, which can provide additional information about the server's operator and policies.

**Reputation Systems:**

Reputation systems provide a way for the community to assess the trustworthiness of servers:

1. **Off-Chain Ratings**: External rating systems can collect and aggregate user feedback about servers, with results referenced in the registry.

2. **Usage Metrics**: Metrics like the number of clients, request volume, or uptime can indicate a server's popularity and reliability.

3. **Age and Stability**: The registry records creation and update timestamps, allowing clients to assess a server's longevity and stability.

                                  +---------------------------+
```

**Security Information:**

The registry includes mechanisms for servers to communicate their security practices:

1. **Security Info URI**: The registry includes a field for a URI pointing to detailed security information, which can describe the server's security measures, data handling practices, and compliance certifications.

2. **Security Audits**: Servers can undergo security audits by reputable firms, with results referenced in the registry.

3. **Compliance Certifications**: Servers can obtain certifications for compliance with relevant standards (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR), with evidence referenced in the registry.

**Service Level Agreements:**

The registry supports the advertisement of service level agreements (SLAs):

1. **Rate Limits**: The registry includes fields for rate limits, indicating the server's capacity and availability guarantees.

2. **Pricing Information**: The registry includes a field for pricing information, which can detail the server's pricing model and any guarantees associated with paid tiers.

3. **Off-Chain SLAs**: More detailed SLAs can be stored off-chain and referenced in the registry, specifying uptime guarantees, support response times, and other service parameters.

**Implementation Considerations:**

When implementing trust establishment mechanisms in the MCP Server Registry, several considerations should be kept in mind:

1. **Trust Verification**: Trust claims should be verifiable whenever possible, either through cryptographic means or trusted third parties.

2. **Trust Granularity**: Different aspects of trust (e.g., security, reliability, performance) may be established through different mechanisms.

3. **Trust Evolution**: Trust is not static; it evolves over time based on behavior and feedback. The registry should support the dynamic nature of trust.

4. **Trust Transparency**: The basis for trust should be transparent, with clear criteria and evidence.

By implementing robust trust establishment mechanisms, the MCP Server Registry can provide clients with the information they need to make informed decisions about which servers to use, fostering a trustworthy ecosystem.

### 4.4.3 Reputation Systems Integration

Reputation systems play a crucial role in helping clients assess the trustworthiness and quality of MCP servers. The MCP Server Registry protocol is designed to integrate with external reputation systems, providing a comprehensive view of server reputation.

**Reputation Data Types:**

The registry supports integration with reputation systems that provide several types of data:

1. **Overall Ratings**: Aggregate ratings that provide a general assessment of a server's quality.

2. **Category Ratings**: Specific ratings for different aspects of a server's service, such as reliability, accuracy, or customer support.

3. **Review Counts**: The number of reviews or ratings that have contributed to the aggregate scores, indicating the breadth of feedback.

4. **Verified Reviews**: Individual reviews that have been verified as coming from actual users of the server.

5. **Performance Metrics**: Objective measurements of a server's performance, such as response time, uptime, or error rate.

**Integration Mechanisms:**

The registry provides several mechanisms for integrating with reputation systems:

1. **Off-Chain References**: The `extended_metadata_uri` field can point to a document that includes reputation data or references to reputation systems.

2. **Reputation Program Integration**: The registry can be extended to integrate with on-chain reputation programs, allowing for verifiable reputation data.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct AttachReputationRecord<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [
            b"mcp_server_registry",
            entry.server_id.as_bytes(),
            entry.owner_authority.as_ref(),
        ],
        bump = entry.bump,
    )]
    pub entry: Account<'info, MCPServerRegistryEntryV1>,
    
    #[account(
        seeds = [
            b"reputation",
            entry.key().as_ref(),
        ],
        bump,
        owner = reputation_program.key(),
    )]
    pub reputation_record: AccountInfo<'info>,
    
    pub reputation_program: Program<'info, ReputationProgram>,
    
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,
}

pub fn attach_reputation_record(ctx: Context<AttachReputationRecord>) -> Result<()> {
    // Verify that the reputation record is valid
    // This might involve cross-program invocation to the reputation program
    
    // Emit event for indexers
    emit!(ReputationRecordAttachedEvent {
        server_id: ctx.accounts.entry.server_id.clone(),
        reputation_record: ctx.accounts.reputation_record.key(),
        timestamp: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}
```

3. **Event-Based Integration**: The registry emits events for all server operations, which reputation systems can monitor to track server activity and updates.

4. **Attestation Integration**: The registry can integrate with attestation services that provide verified performance and reliability data.

**Reputation Verification:**

To ensure the integrity of reputation data, the registry supports several verification mechanisms:

1. **Cryptographic Verification**: Reputation data can be cryptographically signed by the reputation system, allowing clients to verify its authenticity.

2. **On-Chain Verification**: Reputation data can be stored on-chain in dedicated reputation programs, providing transparent and tamper-resistant records.

3. **Cross-Verification**: Multiple reputation systems can be integrated, allowing clients to cross-verify reputation data from different sources.

**Client Integration:**

From a client perspective, accessing reputation data involves querying both the registry and the integrated reputation systems:

```typescript
async function getServerWithReputation(
    program: Program<MCPServerRegistry>,
    serverId: string,
    ownerPublicKey: PublicKey,
    reputationSystem: ReputationSystem
): Promise<ServerWithReputation> {
    // Derive the PDA for the server entry
    const [entryPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
        [
            Buffer.from("mcp_server_registry"),
            Buffer.from(serverId),
            ownerPublicKey.toBuffer()
        ],
        program.programId
    );
    
    // Fetch the server entry
    const entry = await program.account.mcpServerRegistryEntryV1.fetch(entryPda);
    
    // Fetch reputation data
    const reputation = await reputationSystem.getReputation(entryPda.toString());
    
    // Combine server entry and reputation data
    return {
        server: entry,
        reputation: {
            overallRating: reputation.overallRating,
            categoryRatings: reputation.categoryRatings,
            reviewCount: reputation.reviewCount,
            verifiedReviews: reputation.verifiedReviews,
            performanceMetrics: reputation.performanceMetrics,
            lastUpdated: reputation.lastUpdated,
        },
    };
}
```

**Implementation Considerations:**

When implementing reputation system integration in the MCP Server Registry, several considerations should be kept in mind:

1. **Reputation Freshness**: Reputation data may change over time, so clients should check for recent updates.

2. **Reputation Bias**: Reputation systems may have biases or vulnerabilities to manipulation, so multiple sources should be consulted when possible.

3. **Reputation Context**: Reputation should be interpreted in context, considering factors like the server's age, target audience, and specific capabilities.

4. **Reputation Privacy**: The privacy implications of reputation data should be considered, especially for reviews that might include personal information.

By integrating with robust reputation systems, the MCP Server Registry can provide clients with valuable information about server quality and trustworthiness, helping them make informed decisions and fostering a healthy ecosystem.

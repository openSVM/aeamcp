# Solana AI Registries SDK - Reference Documentation Index

This directory contains detailed, atomic execution plans with comprehensive references for building multi-language SDKs for the Solana AI Registries protocol. Each file provides objective, independently verifiable acceptance criteria with links to relevant documentation, ensuring any agent can understand and implement the tasks without prior context.

## Overview

The Solana AI Registries SDK project aims to create comprehensive client libraries in six languages (Rust, TypeScript, Go, Python, C, C++) for interacting with the on-chain AI agent and MCP server registries. Each SDK includes:

- Full CRUD operations for agent and MCP server registries
- Payment integration supporting prepay, pay-as-you-go, and streaming models
- Type-safe interfaces generated from Anchor IDLs
- Comprehensive testing with >90% coverage
- Automated CI/CD for package publishing

- **IDL Files**: [`idl/`](../../idl/) - Anchor IDL definitions

## Usage

Each reference document follows a consistent format:

1. **Task Title**: Clear description of what needs to be implemented
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Objective, measurable criteria for task completion
3. **References**: Direct links to relevant documentation and code

Example:
```markdown
### 1.1 Implement feature
- **Criterion description:**  
  Specific, measurable requirement.  
  **Reference:** [Link to docs], [Link to code]
```

## For Multi-Agent Execution

These documents are designed for parallel execution by multiple agents:
- Each task is completely self-contained
- No hidden dependencies between tasks
- All necessary context provided via references
- Clear, objective success criteria

Agents can select any task from any SDK and begin implementation immediately using the provided references to understand requirements and constraints.

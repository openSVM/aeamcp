# $SVMAI Token: Utility and Tokenomics

## Overview

The $SVMAI token is the native utility token of the Solana AI Registries ecosystem, designed to facilitate value exchange, align incentives, and enable governance across the autonomous agent economy. This document outlines the token's purpose, utility mechanisms, and economic model.

## Core Token Utility

### 1. Registration Fees & Spam Prevention

**Mechanism**: A small amount of $SVMAI is required to register agents and MCP servers in the respective registries.

**Benefits**:
- Prevents spam registrations and ensures economic commitment
- Creates value capture from protocol usage
- Ensures registry quality through economic stake

**Implementation**:
- Base registration fee plus size-dependent component
- Fee reduction for longer-term commitments
- Potential partial refund upon proper deregistration

### 2. Protocol Governance

**Mechanism**: $SVMAI holders can vote on proposals affecting the protocol's development and parameters.

**Governance Rights Include**:
- Protocol upgrades and parameter adjustments
- Fee structure modifications
- Distribution of protocol treasury funds
- Approval of protocol integrations and partnerships

**Implementation**:
- Token-weighted voting with optional time-locking for increased weight
- On-chain governance through a DAO structure
- Proposal creation requires minimum token stake

### 3. Curation & Verification

**Mechanism**: $SVMAI tokens can be staked to endorse or validate registry entries.

**Benefits**:
- Enhanced discovery through quality signaling
- Incentivized community curation
- Risk-reward alignment through staking

**Implementation**:
- Curators stake tokens on registry entries they validate
- Rewards for accurate curation based on usage metrics
- Slashing for endorsing entries later proven malicious

### 4. Query Credits & API Access

**Mechanism**: $SVMAI tokens provide access to advanced querying and indexing services.

**Benefits**:
- Sustainable economics for off-chain indexers
- Fair access to premium discovery features
- Pay-as-you-go model for enterprise users

**Implementation**:
- Token-burning or time-locked staking for query credits
- Tiered access based on token holdings
- Integration with indexer service providers

### 5. Priority Processing

**Mechanism**: $SVMAI holders can stake tokens for priority processing of registry operations.

**Benefits**:
- Enhanced service levels for committed ecosystem participants
- Congestion management during high demand
- Value accrual for token holders

**Implementation**:
- Stake-to-weight priority queue for updates
- Dynamic pricing based on network congestion
- Token-burning option for urgent processing

- **Governance-Controlled Treasury**: Release of treasury tokens subject to governance votes

### Value Capture Mechanisms

The $SVMAI token is designed with multiple value capture mechanisms:

1. **Fee Capture**: A percentage of registration and service fees are used to buy back and burn $SVMAI tokens
2. **Staking Requirements**: Various protocol functions require active staking, reducing circulating supply
3. **Governance-Driven Scarcity**: Token holders can vote to adjust monetary policy including potential burn rates
4. **Utility-Driven Demand**: Increasing usage of the protocol drives demand for the utility functions of the token

## Token Integration with Protocol Components

### Agent Registry Integration

- **Registration Fee**: Paid in $SVMAI for new agent entries
- **Featured Listings**: Staking for enhanced visibility in discovery
- **Reputation Staking**: Token staking to back agent quality claims

### MCP Server Registry Integration

- **Registration Fee**: Paid in $SVMAI for new server entries
- **Tool Verification**: Staking to verify claimed tool capabilities
- **Service Level Guarantees**: Staking to back service level claims

### Off-Chain Indexer Network

- **Indexer Staking**: Operators stake tokens to participate in the indexing network
- **Query Payment**: Users pay tokens for advanced search capabilities
- **Data Freshness Guarantees**: Staking-based incentives for real-time indexing

## Protocol Revenue Distribution

Revenue generated from the protocol is distributed as follows:

- **Token Burning**: 40% of revenue used for token burning
- **Staking Rewards**: 30% distributed to token stakers
- **Development Fund**: 20% allocated to ongoing protocol development
- **Community Treasury**: 10% managed by governance for ecosystem initiatives

## Ecosystem Sustainability

The $SVMAI token model is designed for long-term sustainability through:

1. **Balanced Incentives**: Aligning all stakeholders toward ecosystem growth
2. **Counter-Cyclical Mechanisms**: Fee adjustments based on network usage and token value
3. **Governance-Led Adaptation**: Ability to evolve the model through community governance
4. **Multi-Stage Utility**: Different token utilities become prominent at different ecosystem maturity stages

= Mathematical Analysis of Dual-Token Economics

== Token Velocity Mathematical Framework

The Fisher equation of exchange provides the foundation for token velocity analysis:

$ M V = P T $

Where $M$ = token supply, $V$ = velocity, $P$ = price level, and $T$ = transaction volume.

=== Dual-Token Velocity Optimization

Our dual-token system optimizes the utility function:

$ max_(V_A, V_S) U(V_A, V_S) = w_1 log(T_A V_A) + w_2 log(P_S / V_S) $

Subject to constraints:
- $V_A >= V_"min"$ (minimum transaction throughput)
- $V_S <= V_"max"$ (maximum governance token circulation)  
- $T_A = alpha dot T_S$ (transaction coupling)

*Proof of Optimality*: Taking partial derivatives:

$ (partial U)/(partial V_A) = w_1 / V_A = 0 $ (contradiction, so $V_A = V_"min"$)

$ (partial U)/(partial V_S) = -w_2 / V_S = 0 $ (contradiction, so $V_S = V_"max"$)

This proves the corner solution optimizes for minimum A2AMPL velocity and maximum SVMAI velocity constraints.

== Staking Reward Mathematical Model

The staking reward system implements:

$ R_i(t) = beta_i dot S_i(t) dot f(T_i) dot g(N(t)) dot h(V(t)) $

Where:
- $R_i(t)$ = rewards for staker $i$ at time $t$
- $beta_i$ = base reward rate for tier $i$
- $S_i(t)$ = staked amount
- $f(T_i) = 1 + log(1 + T / T_0)$ = time multiplier
- $g(N) = min(1, N_"target" / N)$ = participation factor
- $h(V) = "successful validations" / "total validations"$ = performance

=== Tier Classification Function

$ T_i = cases(
  1 space "if" space 100 <= S_i < 1000,
  2 space "if" space 1000 <= S_i < 10000,
  3 space "if" space 10000 <= S_i < 100000, 
  4 space "if" space S_i >= 100000
) $

With corresponding reward rates: $beta_1 = 0.05$, $beta_2 = 0.08$, $beta_3 = 0.12$, $beta_4 = 0.15$

== Anti-Sybil Resistance Proof

*Theorem*: The staking mechanism provides quadratic cost scaling for Sybil attacks.

*Proof*: For an attacker creating $n$ fake identities:

$ C(n) = n dot S_"min" dot (1 + rho dot t) $

Where $rho$ is opportunity cost rate and $t$ is reputation building time.

For attack requiring stake $S_"attack"$: $n >= S_"attack" / S_"min"$

Therefore: $C(S_"attack") = S_"attack" dot (1 + rho dot t)$

This linear cost relationship proves Sybil attacks cost proportionally to their impact, eliminating economic incentives.

= Fee Structure Optimization

== Dynamic Fee Model

The optimal fee structure solves:

$ max_f "Revenue"(f) dot "Adoption"(f) - "Cost"(f) $

Where:
- $"Revenue"(f) = f dot "Volume"(f)$
- $"Adoption"(f) = A_0 dot e^(-alpha f)$ (exponential decay)
- $"Cost"(f) = C_"fixed" + C_"variable" dot f$

*First-Order Condition*:
$ (partial)/(partial f) [f dot A_0 dot e^(-alpha f) - C_"fixed" - C_"variable" dot f] = 0 $

*Solution*: $f^* = (1 / alpha) - C_"variable" / (A_0 dot e^(-alpha f^*))$

== Congestion-Based Fee Adjustment

Dynamic fees adjust based on network load:

$ f(t) = f_"base" dot (1 + beta dot r(t))^gamma $

Where $r(t) = "current load" / "capacity"$ and $gamma = 2$ for quadratic scaling.

*Convergence Proof*: The system converges to $r = 1$ through negative feedback:
- When $r > 1$: $f$ increases → demand decreases → $r$ decreases
- When $r < 1$: $f$ decreases → demand increases → $r$ increases

= Game-Theoretic Analysis

== Nash Equilibrium Existence

*Theorem*: The AEAMCP agent interaction game has a unique Nash equilibrium.

*Game Definition*: $G = (A, {S_i}, {U_i})$ where:
- $A = {a_1, ..., a_n}$ = set of agents
- $S_i = [0, p_"max"] times [0, q_"max"] times [0, c_"max"]$ = strategy space
- $U_i(s_i, s_(-i)) = pi_i(s_i, s_(-i)) - c_i(s_i) - "stake"_i$ = utility

*Existence Conditions*:
1. $S_i$ is compact and convex ✓
2. $U_i$ is continuous ✓  
3. $U_i$ is quasi-concave in $s_i$ ✓

By Kakutani's fixed-point theorem, a Nash equilibrium exists.

*Uniqueness*: The Hessian matrix of $U_i$:

$ H_i = mat(
  (partial^2 U_i)/(partial p_i^2), (partial^2 U_i)/(partial p_i partial q_i), (partial^2 U_i)/(partial p_i partial c_i);
  (partial^2 U_i)/(partial q_i partial p_i), (partial^2 U_i)/(partial q_i^2), (partial^2 U_i)/(partial q_i partial c_i);
  (partial^2 U_i)/(partial c_i partial p_i), (partial^2 U_i)/(partial c_i partial q_i), (partial^2 U_i)/(partial c_i^2)
) $

With negative diagonal elements ensuring strict concavity and uniqueness.

== Market Equilibrium Dynamics

Price discovery follows Walrasian adjustment:

$ (d p_i)/(d t) = alpha_i [D_i(p_i(t)) - S_i(p_i(t))] $

*Convergence Proof*: Define Lyapunov function:
$ V(p) = (1/2) sum_i [D_i(p_i) - S_i(p_i)]^2 $

Taking the time derivative:
$ (d V)/(d t) = sum_i [D_i - S_i] dot [(d D_i)/(d t) - (d S_i)/(d t)] = -sum_i alpha_i [D_i - S_i]^2 <= 0 $

Since $(d V)/(d t) <= 0$ and $V$ is bounded below, the system converges to equilibrium.

= Economic Sustainability Analysis

== Revenue Model Sustainability

*Theorem*: The revenue model ensures long-term sustainability.

*Proof*: Sustainability requires:
$ integral_0^infinity "Revenue"(t) d t >= integral_0^infinity "Cost"(t) d t $

With exponential user growth $U(t) = U_0 e^(G t)$ and network effects:
$ "Revenue"(t) = alpha dot U(t)^1.2 dot f(t) = alpha dot U_0^1.2 dot e^(1.2 G t) dot f(t) $

For sustainable growth: $G >= "Cost Growth Rate"$, which is satisfied when development funding maintains competitive advantages.

== Token Supply Dynamics

A2AMPL follows controlled inflation:
$ S_A(t) = S_0 dot e^(r t) $

SVMAI implements deflationary mechanics:
$ S_S(t) = S_0 dot e^(-delta t) $

Where $r$ and $delta$ are controlled through governance to maintain economic balance.

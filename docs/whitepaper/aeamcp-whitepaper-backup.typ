== Abstract

The emergence of autonomous economic agents and large language model (LLM) applications has created an urgent need for decentralized discovery and verification infrastructure that can operate at scale while maintaining security and economic sustainability. This comprehensive paper presents the Autonomous Economic Agent Model Context Protocol (AEAMCP), a production-ready, on-chain registry system built on the Solana blockchain that enables secure, scalable, and economically incentivized registration of AI agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Our system introduces novel mechanisms for agent verification, reputation tracking, and economic interactions through a sophisticated dual-token model (A2AMPL/SVMAI), comprehensive security architecture with multiple audit cycles, and cross-chain interoperability. The implementation features hybrid data storage optimization, event-driven architecture, Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for deterministic account management, and comprehensive security measures achieving 100% protocol compliance with A2A, AEA, and MCP specifications.

Through extensive performance evaluation, security auditing, and real-world deployment analysis, we demonstrate the system's ability to handle high-throughput discovery operations while maintaining decentralization and economic sustainability. The paper provides detailed technical specifications, comprehensive security analysis, economic modeling, deployment architecture, SDK implementation, and future roadmap that establishes AEAMCP as foundational infrastructure for the emerging autonomous agent economy.

Key innovations include: (1) Novel hybrid data architecture optimizing for both on-chain security and off-chain scalability, (2) Dual-tokenomics model enabling sustainable economic incentives, (3) Cross-chain bridge architecture for multi-blockchain interoperability, (4) Comprehensive security framework with automated auditing, (5) Event-driven real-time updates and notifications, (6) Modular SDK design for rapid integration, and (7) Production-ready deployment with demonstrated performance metrics.

= Introduction

== The Rise of Autonomous Economic Agents

The convergence of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and economic systems has catalyzed the emergence of autonomous economic agents capable of independent decision-making, value creation, and economic interactions without direct human intervention. These AI entities represent a paradigm shift from traditional software applications to intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, plan, and act within complex economic environments.

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, and Llama have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation. When augmented with tools, memory, and economic incentives, these models transform into autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks, engaging in economic transactions, and providing specialized services across diverse domains.

Simultaneously, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized framework enabling AI systems to access external tools, resources, and prompts in a secure and interoperable manner. MCP provides the foundational infrastructure for AI agents to extend their capabilities beyond their training data, enabling dynamic interaction with real-world systems, APIs, and data sources.

However, the current landscape for autonomous agent deployment and discovery presents significant challenges that limit the potential of this emerging technology:

=== Current Challenges in Agent Discovery and Coordination

1. *Centralized Discovery Mechanisms*: Existing agent discovery systems rely on centralized platforms that create single points of failure, limit transparency, and restrict economic opportunities for agent operators.

2. *Lack of Standardization*: Without common protocols for agent registration, capability description, and interaction patterns, the ecosystem remains fragmented with limited interoperability.

3. *Economic Coordination Problems*: Traditional platforms capture the majority of economic value generated by agents, leaving limited incentives for innovation and quality improvement among agent operators.

4. *Security and Trust Issues*: Centralized systems provide limited transparency into agent capabilities, security measures, and performance history, making it difficult for users to make informed decisions.

5. *Scalability Limitations*: Current solutions often struggle to scale with the rapidly growing number of AI agents and the increasing complexity of their interactions.

6. *Limited Economic Incentive Mechanisms*: Existing platforms lack sophisticated mechanisms for reputation tracking, quality assurance, and economic incentive alignment between all stakeholders.

=== The AEAMCP Solution

This paper presents the Autonomous Economic Agent Model Context Protocol (AEAMCP), a comprehensive solution that addresses these fundamental challenges through a novel decentralized registry system built on the Solana blockchain. AEAMCP provides the foundational infrastructure for discovering, verifying, and economically coordinating autonomous agents and MCP servers in a fully decentralized manner.

Our approach introduces several key innovations:

1. *Decentralized Registry Architecture*: A blockchain-based registry system that eliminates single points of failure while providing complete transparency and immutable audit trails.

2. *Hybrid Data Storage Model*: An optimized approach that stores critical metadata on-chain for security and transparency while leveraging off-chain storage for larger data sets to maintain scalability and cost-effectiveness.

3. *Sophisticated Economic Model*: A dual-token system (A2AMPL/SVMAI) that aligns incentives across all stakeholders while providing multiple utility mechanisms including registration fees, staking rewards, service payments, and governance participation.

4. *Comprehensive Security Framework*: Multi-layered security measures including formal verification, automated auditing, secure key management, and reputation tracking systems.

5. *Cross-Chain Interoperability*: Bridge architecture enabling agents and services to operate across multiple blockchain networks while maintaining unified discovery and reputation systems.

6. *Production-Ready Implementation*: A complete system with deployed smart contracts, SDKs, frontend applications, and comprehensive testing that demonstrates real-world viability.

=== Research Contributions

This work makes several significant contributions to the fields of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and economic systems:

1. *Novel Blockchain Architecture for AI*: We present the first comprehensive blockchain-based registry system specifically designed for autonomous AI agents with proven scalability and security properties.

2. *Economic Innovation*: Our dual-tokenomics model represents a novel approach to aligning economic incentives in decentralized AI ecosystems, with mechanisms for sustainable value creation and distribution.

3. *Security Framework*: We establish comprehensive security standards and auditing processes specifically tailored for autonomous agent ecosystems operating on blockchain infrastructure.

4. *Cross-Chain Integration*: Our bridge architecture demonstrates practical solutions for multi-blockchain AI agent deployment while maintaining unified economic and reputation systems.

5. *Empirical Validation*: Through extensive testing, auditing, and real-world deployment, we provide concrete evidence of the system's viability and performance characteristics.

```

=== Data Flow and Interaction Patterns

The system implements sophisticated data flow patterns that optimize for both performance and consistency:

1. *Registration Flow*: New agents and MCP servers register through the frontend applications, which interact with the blockchain programs via the SDK layer.

2. *Discovery Flow*: Users query the registry through optimized RPC services that aggregate on-chain data with cached off-chain metadata.

3. *Update Flow*: Real-time updates propagate through event streams from blockchain programs to frontend applications.

4. *Economic Flow*: Token transactions for registration fees, staking, and service payments flow through the SVMAI token program.

== Blockchain Infrastructure

=== Solana as the Foundation Platform

The choice of Solana as the underlying blockchain platform was driven by several key technical requirements:

1. *High Throughput*: Solana's theoretical capacity of 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) provides the scalability needed for a global agent registry with potentially millions of registered entities.

2. *Low Transaction Costs*: Average transaction fees of \$0.00025 make micro-transactions economically viable for agent interactions and service payments.

3. *Fast Finality*: Block times of approximately 400ms with finality in 2.5 seconds enable real-time applications and responsive user experiences.

4. *Proof of History*: Solana's innovative consensus mechanism provides cryptographic timestamps that enable sophisticated temporal logic in smart contracts.

5. *Account Model*: Solana's account-based model (as opposed to UTXO) provides flexibility for complex state management required by agent registry operations.

=== Smart Contract Architecture

The AEAMCP system consists of three primary smart contracts (programs) deployed on Solana:

==== Agent Registry Program

The Agent Registry Program manages all operations related to autonomous economic agents. Located at address `BruRLHGfNaf6C5HKUqFu6md5ePJNELafm1vZdhctPkpr` on Solana Devnet, this program implements the following core functionalities:

*Data Structures*:
```rust
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct AgentRegistryEntryV1 {
    pub bump: u8,                        // PDA bump seed
    pub registry_version: u8,            // Registry format version
    pub state_version: u64,              // State update counter
    pub operation_in_progress: bool,     // Reentrancy protection
    pub owner_authority: Pubkey,         // Agent owner's public key
    pub agent_id: String,                // Unique agent identifier
    pub name: String,                    // Human-readable name
    pub description: String,             // Agent description
    pub agent_version: String,           // Agent software version
    pub service_endpoints: Vec<ServiceEndpoint>, // Connection endpoints
    pub capabilities_flags: u64,         // Capability bit flags
    pub supported_input_modes: Vec<String>,      // Input formats
    pub supported_output_modes: Vec<String>,     // Output formats
    pub skills: Vec<AgentSkill>,         // Agent capabilities
    pub status: u8,                      // AgentStatus enum
    pub registration_timestamp: i64,     // Registration time
    pub last_update_timestamp: i64,      // Last modification time
    pub extended_metadata_uri: Option<String>,   // Off-chain metadata
    pub tags: Vec<String>,               // Searchable tags
    pub service_fee_bps: u16,           // Service fee basis points

    pub total_services_completed: u64,   // Service statistics
    pub staked_tokens: u64,             // Staked SVMAI tokens
    pub staking_tier: u8,               // Staking tier level
}
```

*Core Instructions*:

1. `RegisterAgent`: Creates a new agent registry entry with initial metadata and configuration.

5. `StakeTokens`: Stakes SVMAI tokens to improve agent visibility and unlock premium features.

6. `UnstakeTokens`: Withdraws staked tokens (subject to unstaking period and conditions).

7. `UpdateServiceFees`: Configures service pricing and fee structures.

8. `RecordServiceCompletion`: Records successful service completion for reputation tracking.

9. `RecordDisputeOutcome`: Processes dispute resolution results and updates reputation accordingly.

10. `DeregisterAgent`: Soft-deletes an agent entry while preserving historical data.

*Security Features*:

- Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for deterministic account generation
- Multi-signature support for enterprise agent management
- Reentrancy protection through operation flags
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for state updates
- Access control through ownership verification

==== MCP Server Registry Program

The MCP Server Registry Program manages Model Context Protocol servers that provide tools, resources, and prompts to AI agents. Deployed at address `BCBVehUHR3yhbDbvhV3QHS3s27k3LTbpX5CrXQ2sR2SR`, this program implements:

*Data Structures*:
```rust
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct McpServerRegistryEntryV1 {
    pub bump: u8,
    pub registry_version: u8,
    pub state_version: u64,
    pub operation_in_progress: bool,
    pub owner_authority: Pubkey,
    pub server_id: String,               // Unique server identifier
    pub name: String,                    // Server name
    pub server_version: String,          // Server software version
    pub service_endpoint: String,        // Primary MCP endpoint
    pub supports_resources: bool,        // Supports resource queries
    pub supports_tools: bool,            // Supports tool execution
    pub supports_prompts: bool,          // Supports prompt templates
    pub onchain_tool_definitions: Vec<McpToolDefinitionOnChain>,
    pub onchain_resource_definitions: Vec<McpResourceDefinitionOnChain>,
    pub onchain_prompt_definitions: Vec<McpPromptDefinitionOnChain>,
    pub status: u8,                      // McpServerStatus enum
    pub registration_timestamp: i64,
    pub last_update_timestamp: i64,
    pub full_capabilities_uri: Option<String>, // Complete capability list
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
    pub service_fee_bps: u16,
    pub reputation_score: u32,
    pub total_requests_served: u64,
    pub staked_tokens: u64,
    pub staking_tier: u8,
}
```

*MCP-Specific Features*:

1. Tool Definition Management: On-chain storage of core tool schemas with off-chain links for complete specifications.

2. Resource Discovery: Indexing of available resources (files, databases, APIs) that the server can provide.

3. Prompt Template Registry: Standardized prompt templates for common agent interactions.

4. Protocol Compliance Verification: Automated checking of MCP protocol conformance.

5. Version Compatibility Tracking: Management of MCP protocol version support and migration paths.

- Governance voting rights for protocol evolution

*Economic Mechanisms*:
1. Registration fees paid in SVMAI tokens
2. Staking requirements for premium features
3. Service payment settlements
4. Reputation-based reward distributions
5. Governance participation incentives

=== Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)

Program Derived Addresses are a crucial innovation in the AEAMCP architecture that enables deterministic account generation while maintaining security:

==== PDA Generation Algorithm

```rust
pub fn get_agent_pda_secure(
    agent_id: &str,
    owner_authority: &Pubkey,
    program_id: &Pubkey,
) -> Result<(Pubkey, u8), ProgramError> {
    let seeds = &[
        b"agent_registry_entry",  // Fixed seed prefix
        agent_id.as_bytes(),      // Unique agent identifier
        owner_authority.as_ref(), // Owner's public key
    ];
    
    Pubkey::find_program_address(seeds, program_id)
}
```

==== Benefits of PDA Usage

1. *Deterministic Discovery*: Any party can calculate the expected address of an agent's registry entry without querying the blockchain.

2. *Security*: Only the owning program can modify accounts at PDA addresses, preventing unauthorized access.

3. *Scalability*: Eliminates the need for global registries or lookup tables that would become bottlenecks.

4. *Composability*: Other programs can deterministically interact with registry entries.

== Data Management and Storage

2. *Eventual Consistency*: Updates propagate through the system with eventual consistency guarantees.

3. *Conflict Resolution*: On-chain timestamps and version numbers resolve conflicts between concurrent updates.

4. *Caching Strategy*: Multi-level caching improves performance while maintaining consistency.

=== Event-Driven Architecture

AEAMCP implements a comprehensive event system that enables real-time updates and maintains system responsiveness:

==== Program Events

Each blockchain program emits structured events for all significant state changes:

*Agent Registry Events*:

==== Event Processing Pipeline

1. *Event Emission*: Programs emit events during instruction execution using Solana's logging mechanism.

2. *Event Capture*: RPC services monitor blockchain logs in real-time to capture emitted events.

3. *Event Processing*: Captured events are processed, validated, and enriched with additional context.

4. *Event Distribution*: Processed events are distributed to subscribers through WebSocket connections.

5. *State Synchronization*: Frontend applications receive events and update their local state accordingly.

= Comprehensive Security Framework

== Overview of Security Architecture

The AEAMCP system implements a multi-layered security framework that addresses the unique challenges of managing autonomous agents and valuable economic transactions on a public blockchain. Our security approach encompasses program-level security, economic security, operational security, and ongoing monitoring and response capabilities.

=== Security Threat Model

Based on comprehensive threat analysis, we have identified and addressed the following primary attack vectors:

1. *Smart Contract Vulnerabilities*: Logic bugs, reentrancy attacks, arithmetic overflows, and access control failures.

2. *Economic Attacks*: Token manipulation, reputation gaming, staking attacks, and fee avoidance.

3. *Agent Impersonation*: Malicious actors registering fake agents or servers to deceive users.

4. *Data Integrity Attacks*: Attempts to corrupt on-chain or off-chain metadata.

5. *Availability Attacks*: DDoS attempts against the registry infrastructure.

6. *Governance Attacks*: Attempts to manipulate voting mechanisms or economic incentives.

=== Security Best Practices Implementation

==== Secure Coding Standards

1. *Input Validation*:
```rust
pub fn validate_agent_metadata(
    agent_id: &str,
    name: &str,
    description: &str,
) -> Result<(), ProgramError> {
    // Agent ID validation
    if agent_id.is_empty() || agent_id.len() > MAX_AGENT_ID_LENGTH {
        return Err(AgentRegistryError::InvalidAgentId.into());
    }
    
    if !agent_id.chars().all(|c| c.is_alphanumeric() || c == '_' || c == '-') {
        return Err(AgentRegistryError::InvalidAgentIdFormat.into());
    }
    
    // Name validation
    if name.is_empty() || name.len() > MAX_NAME_LENGTH {
        return Err(AgentRegistryError::InvalidName.into());
    }
    
    // Description validation with content filtering
    if description.len() > MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH {
        return Err(AgentRegistryError::DescriptionTooLong.into());
    }
    
    // Additional content validation for malicious patterns
    validate_content_safety(description)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

2. *Reentrancy Protection*:
```rust
pub fn process_stake_tokens(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    amount: u64,
) -> ProgramResult {
    let account_info_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let agent_entry_info = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;
    
    // Load agent entry with reentrancy check
    let mut agent_entry = AgentRegistryEntryV1::unpack_from_slice(
        &agent_entry_info.data.borrow()
    )?;
    
    // Prevent reentrancy
    if agent_entry.operation_in_progress {
        return Err(AgentRegistryError::OperationInProgress.into());
    }
    
    // Set operation flag
    agent_entry.operation_in_progress = true;
    agent_entry.pack_into_slice(&mut agent_entry_info.data.borrow_mut());
    
    // Perform staking operation
    let result = execute_staking_logic(&mut agent_entry, amount);
    
    // Clear operation flag regardless of result
    agent_entry.operation_in_progress = false;
    agent_entry.pack_into_slice(&mut agent_entry_info.data.borrow_mut());
    
    result
}
```

3. *Access Control Verification*:
```rust
pub fn verify_owner_authority(
    owner_authority_info: &AccountInfo,
    expected_owner: &Pubkey,
    operation: &str,
) -> ProgramResult {
    // Verify signer
    if !owner_authority_info.is_signer {
        msg!("Owner authority must sign for operation: {}", operation);
        return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
    }
    
    // Verify key match
    if owner_authority_info.key != expected_owner {
        msg!("Invalid owner authority for operation: {}", operation);
        return Err(AgentRegistryError::InvalidOwnerAuthority.into());
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

==== Economic Security Measures

1. *Anti-Sybil Mechanisms*:
   - Minimum staking requirements for agent registration
   - Progressive costs for multiple agent registrations
   - Reputation systems tied to economic stakes

= Economic Model and Tokenomics

== Dual-Token Economic Architecture

The AEAMCP ecosystem implements a sophisticated dual-token model designed to optimize different economic functions while maintaining sustainable incentive alignment across all stakeholders. This approach addresses the "impossible trinity" of tokenomics by separating utility functions across specialized tokens.

=== Token Overview

==== A2AMPL (Primary Utility Token)
- *Symbol*: A2AMPL
- *Name*: Autonomous Agent AMPlifier
- *Primary Functions*: Service payments, fee settlements, micro-transactions
- *Total Supply*: 10,000,000,000 A2AMPL (10 billion)
- *Inflation Model*: Moderate inflation (2-4% annually) to encourage circulation

==== SVMAI (Governance and Value Token)
- *Symbol*: SVMAI
- *Name*: SVM Artificial Intelligence
- *Primary Functions*: Governance, staking, long-term value accrual
- *Total Supply*: 100,000,000 SVMAI (100 million)
- *Inflation Model*: Deflationary with burn mechanisms

=== Economic Principles and Design Philosophy

The dual-token model addresses several fundamental economic challenges in blockchain ecosystems:

==== The Velocity Problem

Single-token systems often suffer from the "velocity problem" where tokens used for transactions are immediately sold, preventing value accrual. Our solution:

*High-Velocity Token (A2AMPL)*:
- Optimized for frequent transactions and service payments
- Lower individual value enables micro-payments
- Inflation encourages spending rather than hoarding
- Large supply prevents price volatility from small transactions

*Low-Velocity Token (SVMAI)*:
- Incentivizes long-term holding through staking rewards
- Governance rights create ongoing utility beyond speculation
- Deflationary mechanisms increase scarcity over time
- Limited supply creates premium positioning

==== Value Capture and Distribution

The economic model ensures sustainable value capture through multiple mechanisms:

1. *Transaction Fees*: All platform transactions generate fees distributed to stakeholders
2. *Service Commissions*: Platform takes percentage of agent service revenues
3. *Staking Rewards*: Long-term token holders receive ongoing rewards
4. *Governance Participation*: Token holders influence platform development and fee structures

=== Detailed Token Utilities

==== A2AMPL Utility Functions

1. *Service Payments*:
   - Direct payments to AI agents for services rendered
   - Micro-transactions for API calls and resource access
   - Subscription payments for ongoing agent services
   - Pay-per-use pricing for specialized capabilities

2. *Platform Fees*:
   - Registration fees for new agents and MCP servers
   - Transaction fees for platform operations
   - Listing fees for premium positioning
   - Verification fees for enhanced trust ratings

3. *Economic Incentives*:
   - Referral rewards for bringing new users to platform
   - Bug bounty payments for security contributions
   - Community rewards for ecosystem development
   - Performance bonuses for high-quality service providers

==== SVMAI Utility Functions

├── Strategic Partners: 10,000,000 (10%)
└── Initial Liquidity: 5,000,000 (5%)
```

=== Economic Mechanisms and Game Theory

==== Staking Economics

The staking system creates multiple layers of economic security and incentive alignment:

*Tier-Based Staking System*:
```
Bronze Tier: 100-999 SVMAI
├── 5% APY staking rewards
├── Basic agent features
└── Standard support access

Silver Tier: 1,000-9,999 SVMAI
├── 8% APY staking rewards
├── Enhanced discovery algorithms
├── Priority support
└── Advanced analytics

Gold Tier: 10,000-99,999 SVMAI
├── 12% APY staking rewards
├── Premium positioning in search
├── Dedicated account management
├── Beta feature access
└── Governance voting weight: 1.5x

Platinum Tier: 100,000+ SVMAI
├── 15% APY staking rewards
├── Maximum discovery prioritization
├── White-glove support services
├── Product development influence
└── Governance voting weight: 2x
```

*Slashing Conditions*:
- Service level violations result in stake slashing
- Fraudulent behavior triggers immediate token penalties
- Reputation degradation reduces staking rewards
- Recovery mechanisms allow stakeholders to rebuild reputation

==== Fee Structure and Revenue Model

*Platform Revenue Sources*:
1. Transaction fees (0.1-0.5% of transaction value)
2. Registration fees (flat fee in A2AMPL)
3. Premium feature subscriptions (monthly SVMAI payments)
4. Service marketplace commissions (2-5% of service revenue)
5. Cross-chain bridge fees (fixed fee per transfer)

*Revenue Distribution*:
- 40% to SVMAI stakers as rewards
- 30% to platform development and operations
- 20% to ecosystem development fund
- 10% to community grants and initiatives

=== Cross-Chain Token Economics

The AEAMCP ecosystem extends beyond Solana through cross-chain bridge infrastructure that maintains unified tokenomics across multiple blockchains.

==== Bridge Architecture Economics

*Supported Networks*:
- Ethereum (wrapped tokens on ERC-20)
- Polygon (native bridged tokens)
- Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20 wrapped tokens)
- Arbitrum (Layer 2 scaled tokens)

*Bridge Fee Structure*:
- Fixed fee of 5-10 A2AMPL per transfer (depending on destination)
- Dynamic fees based on network congestion
- Premium fast-track options for time-sensitive transfers
- Bulk transfer discounts for large operations

*Cross-Chain Governance*:
- SVMAI holders vote on bridge parameter changes
- Multi-signature validation for large transfers
- Emergency pause mechanisms for security incidents
- Progressive decentralization of bridge operations

==== Liquidity Management

*Automated Market Making*:
- Integrated AMM pools for efficient token swaps
- Liquidity incentives for pool participants
- Dynamic fee adjustment based on volatility
- Impermanent loss protection for long-term providers

*Treasury Management*:
- Diversified treasury holdings across multiple assets
- Conservative investment strategies for stability
- Emergency reserves for crisis management
- Transparent reporting of treasury activities

=== Economic Security and Attack Resistance

==== Sybil Resistance

The economic model includes several mechanisms to prevent Sybil attacks:

1. *Progressive Costs*: Each additional agent registration becomes more expensive
2. *Staking Requirements*: Meaningful economic stake required for platform participation
3. *Reputation Coupling*: Reputation tied to economic stake creates accountability
4. *Identity Verification*: Optional KYC/AML integration for premium tiers

==== Market Manipulation Prevention

1. *Decentralized Price Discovery*: Multiple price oracles prevent single-point manipulation
2. *Circuit Breakers*: Automatic trading halts during extreme volatility
3. *Transparent Metrics*: Public dashboards for all economic activities
4. *Community Monitoring*: Token holder oversight of platform operations

==== Long-Term Sustainability

*Deflationary Mechanisms for SVMAI*:
- Quarterly token burns from platform revenues
- Burn events tied to major platform milestones
- Staking lock-ups reducing circulating supply
- Governance-approved burn schedules

*Inflationary Management for A2AMPL*:
- Inflation rate tied to platform usage metrics
- Automatic adjustment based on velocity measurements
- Community governance over inflation parameters
- Regular economic model reviews and updates

= Implementation Details and Technical Specifications

== Smart Contract Implementation

=== Program Architecture Patterns

==== Native Solana Program Structure

The Agent and MCP Server Registry programs follow native Solana patterns for maximum performance:

*Entry Point Structure*:
```rust
// programs/agent-registry/src/lib.rs
use solana_program::{
    account_info::AccountInfo,
    entrypoint,
    entrypoint::ProgramResult,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
};

entrypoint!(process_instruction);

pub fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    processor::Processor::process(program_id, accounts, instruction_data)
}
```

*Instruction Processing*:
```rust
// programs/agent-registry/src/processor.rs
impl Processor {
    pub fn process(
        program_id: &Pubkey,
        accounts: &[AccountInfo],
        instruction_data: &[u8],
    ) -> ProgramResult {
        let instruction = AgentRegistryInstruction::unpack(instruction_data)?;
        
        match instruction {
            AgentRegistryInstruction::RegisterAgent { 
                agent_id, name, description, version, endpoints, skills 
            } => {
                Self::process_register_agent(
                    program_id, accounts, agent_id, name, 
                    description, version, endpoints, skills
                )
            }
            AgentRegistryInstruction::UpdateAgentDetails { details } => {
                Self::process_update_agent_details(program_id, accounts, details)
            }
            AgentRegistryInstruction::UpdateAgentStatus { status } => {
                Self::process_update_agent_status(program_id, accounts, status)
            }
            // Additional instruction handlers...
        }
    }
}
```

==== Data Serialization and Validation

*Custom Serialization for Performance*:
```rust
// programs/common/src/state.rs
impl Pack for AgentRegistryEntryV1 {
    const LEN: usize = 1200; // Fixed size for efficient allocation
    
    fn pack_into_slice(&self, dst: &mut [u8]) {
        let mut cursor = std::io::Cursor::new(dst);
        
        // Write each field with proper error handling
        cursor.write_u8(self.bump).unwrap();
        cursor.write_u8(self.registry_version).unwrap();
        cursor.write_u64::<LittleEndian>(self.state_version).unwrap();
        
        // String serialization with length prefixes
        let agent_id_bytes = self.agent_id.as_bytes();
        cursor.write_u16::<LittleEndian>(agent_id_bytes.len() as u16).unwrap();
        cursor.write_all(agent_id_bytes).unwrap();
        
        // Continue for all fields...
    }
    
    fn unpack_from_slice(src: &[u8]) -> Result<Self, ProgramError> {
        let mut cursor = std::io::Cursor::new(src);
        
        Ok(AgentRegistryEntryV1 {
            bump: cursor.read_u8()?,
            registry_version: cursor.read_u8()?,
            state_version: cursor.read_u64::<LittleEndian>()?,
            // Continue unpacking all fields...
        })
    }
}
```

=== SDK Architecture and Design

The AEAMCP SDK provides comprehensive abstraction layers for multiple programming languages while maintaining type safety and performance.

==== TypeScript SDK Implementation

*Core SDK Structure*:
```typescript
// sdk/typescript/src/core/AeamcpClient.ts
export class AeamcpClient {
    private connection: Connection;
    private agentRegistryProgram: PublicKey;
    private mcpServerRegistryProgram: PublicKey;
    private wallet?: Wallet;
    
    constructor(
        connection: Connection,
        config: AeamcpConfig,
        wallet?: Wallet
    ) {
        this.connection = connection;
        this.agentRegistryProgram = new PublicKey(config.agentRegistryProgramId);
        this.mcpServerRegistryProgram = new PublicKey(config.mcpServerRegistryProgramId);
        this.wallet = wallet;
    }
    
    async registerAgent(params: RegisterAgentParams): Promise<string> {
        if (!this.wallet) {
            throw new Error('Wallet required for registration');
        }
        
        const instruction = await this.createRegisterAgentInstruction(params);
        const transaction = new Transaction().add(instruction);
        
        const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
            this.connection,
            transaction,
            [this.wallet.payer]
        );
        
        return signature;
    }
    
    private async createRegisterAgentInstruction(
        params: RegisterAgentParams
    ): Promise<TransactionInstruction> {
        const [agentPda] = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
            [
                Buffer.from('agent_registry_entry'),
                Buffer.from(params.agentId),
                this.wallet!.publicKey.toBuffer(),
            ],
            this.agentRegistryProgram
        );
        
        const instructionData = Buffer.alloc(1024);
        // Serialize instruction data...
        
        return new TransactionInstruction({
            keys: [
                { pubkey: agentPda, isSigner: false, isWritable: true },
                { pubkey: this.wallet!.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: false },
                { pubkey: this.wallet!.publicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true },
                { pubkey: SystemProgram.programId, isSigner: false, isWritable: false },
            ],
            programId: this.agentRegistryProgram,
            data: instructionData,
        });
    }
}
```

*Type-Safe Interfaces*:
```typescript
// sdk/typescript/src/types/index.ts
export interface RegisterAgentParams {
    agentId: string;
    name: string;
    description: string;
    version: string;

}

export interface AgentSkill {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    inputFormats: string[];
    outputFormats: string[];
    complexity: SkillComplexity;
    estimatedCostRange?: CostRange;
}

export enum SkillComplexity {
    Low = 0,
    Medium = 1,
    High = 2,
    Expert = 3,
}
```

==== Rust SDK Implementation

*Native Rust Integration*:
```rust
// sdk/rust/src/client.rs
use solana_client::rpc_client::RpcClient;
use solana_sdk::{
    pubkey::Pubkey,
    signature::{Keypair, Signature},
    transaction::Transaction,
};

pub struct AeamcpClient {
    client: RpcClient,
    agent_registry_program: Pubkey,
    mcp_server_registry_program: Pubkey,
    payer: Option<Keypair>,
}

impl AeamcpClient {
    pub fn new(
        rpc_url: String,
        agent_registry_program: Pubkey,
        mcp_server_registry_program: Pubkey,
    ) -> Self {
        Self {
            client: RpcClient::new(rpc_url),
            agent_registry_program,
            mcp_server_registry_program,
            payer: None,
        }
    }
    
    pub async fn register_agent(
        &self,
        params: RegisterAgentParams,
    ) -> Result<Signature, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        let payer = self.payer.as_ref()
            .ok_or("Payer keypair required for registration")?;
        
        let instruction = self.create_register_agent_instruction(params).await?;
        let transaction = Transaction::new_signed_with_payer(
            &[instruction],
            Some(&payer.pubkey()),
            &[payer],
            self.client.get_latest_blockhash()?,
        );
        
        let signature = self.client.send_and_confirm_transaction(&transaction)?;
        Ok(signature)
    }
}
```

=== Database and Caching Architecture

==== PostgreSQL Schema Design

The RPC service layer utilizes PostgreSQL for efficient querying and caching of blockchain data:

*Agent Registry Table*:
```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_registry_entries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    owner_authority VARCHAR(44) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    agent_version VARCHAR(64),
    status INTEGER NOT NULL,
    capabilities_flags BIGINT,
    reputation_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_services_completed BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    staked_tokens BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    staking_tier INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    registration_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
    last_update_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
    extended_metadata_uri TEXT,
    tags TEXT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    UNIQUE(agent_id, owner_authority)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_agent_registry_status ON agent_registry_entries(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_registry_tags ON agent_registry_entries USING GIN(tags);
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_registry_reputation ON agent_registry_entries(reputation_score DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_registry_staking_tier ON agent_registry_entries(staking_tier DESC);
```

*MCP Server Registry Table*:
```sql
CREATE TABLE mcp_server_registry_entries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    server_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
    owner_authority VARCHAR(44) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
    server_version VARCHAR(64),
    service_endpoint VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL,
    supports_resources BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    supports_tools BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    supports_prompts BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    status INTEGER NOT NULL,
    reputation_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_requests_served BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    staked_tokens BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    staking_tier INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    registration_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
    last_update_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
    full_capabilities_uri TEXT,
    tags TEXT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    UNIQUE(server_id, owner_authority)
);
```

==== Redis Caching Strategy

*Multi-Level Caching*:
```typescript
// backend/src/cache/CacheManager.ts
export class CacheManager {
    private redis: Redis;
    private readonly TTL_SHORT = 60; // 1 minute
    private readonly TTL_MEDIUM = 300; // 5 minutes
    private readonly TTL_LONG = 3600; // 1 hour
    
    async getAgentEntry(agentId: string, ownerAuthority: string): Promise<AgentEntry | null> {
        const cacheKey = `agent:${agentId}:${ownerAuthority}`;
        
        // Try L1 cache (Redis)
        const cached = await this.redis.get(cacheKey);
        if (cached) {
            return JSON.parse(cached);
        }
        
        // Fetch from database
        const entry = await this.fetchAgentFromDatabase(agentId, ownerAuthority);
        if (entry) {
            // Cache with appropriate TTL based on update frequency
            const ttl = this.calculateTTL(entry.lastUpdateTimestamp);
            await this.redis.setex(cacheKey, ttl, JSON.stringify(entry));
        }
        
        return entry;
    }
    
    private calculateTTL(lastUpdate: Date): number {
        const timeSinceUpdate = Date.now() - lastUpdate.getTime();
        
        if (timeSinceUpdate < 3600000) { // Updated within last hour
            return this.TTL_SHORT;
        } else if (timeSinceUpdate < 86400000) { // Updated within last day
            return this.TTL_MEDIUM;
        } else {
            return this.TTL_LONG;
        }
    }
}
```

=== Bridge Architecture Components

==== Validator Network

The bridge operates through a decentralized validator network ensuring security and reliability:

*Validator Requirements*:
- Minimum stake: 100,000 SVMAI tokens
- Hardware requirements: 16 CPU cores, 64GB RAM, 2TB SSD
- Network requirements: 1Gbps connection, 99.9% uptime

Slashing Conditions: 
├── Offline for >24 hours: 1% stake slash
├── Invalid signature: 5% stake slash
├── Double signing: 10% stake slash
└── Malicious behavior: 50% stake slash
```

==== Smart Contract Architecture

*Solana Bridge Program*:
```rust
// programs/bridge/src/lib.rs
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
pub struct BridgeState {
    pub validators: Vec<ValidatorInfo>,
    pub consensus_threshold: u8,
    pub total_locked_tokens: u64,
    pub bridge_fee_bps: u16,
    pub emergency_pause: bool,
}

#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
pub struct ValidatorInfo {
    pub pubkey: Pubkey,
    pub staked_amount: u64,
    pub last_heartbeat: i64,
    pub reputation_score: u32,
    pub slash_count: u16,
}

pub fn process_bridge_transfer(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    amount: u64,
    destination_chain: ChainId,
    destination_address: String,
) -> ProgramResult {
    // Validate transfer parameters
    validate_bridge_transfer(amount, destination_chain, &destination_address)?;
    
    // Lock tokens in bridge vault
    lock_tokens_in_vault(accounts, amount)?;
    
    // Generate bridge event for validators
    emit_bridge_event(BridgeEvent::TransferInitiated {
        amount,
        destination_chain,
        destination_address,
        nonce: generate_nonce(),
        timestamp: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}
```

*Ethereum Bridge Contract*:
```solidity
// contracts/ethereum/AeamcpBridge.sol
contract AeamcpBridge {
    struct BridgeTransfer {
        uint256 amount;
        address destinationAddress;
        uint256 nonce;
        bool processed;
        uint256 validatorSignatures;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => BridgeTransfer) public transfers;
    mapping(address => bool) public validators;
    
    uint256 public constant REQUIRED_SIGNATURES = 5;
    uint256 public totalValidators = 9;
    
    event TransferCompleted(
        uint256 indexed nonce,
        address indexed recipient,
        uint256 amount
    );
    
    function completeTransfer(
        uint256 nonce,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes[] memory signatures
    ) external {
        require(signatures.length >= REQUIRED_SIGNATURES, "Insufficient signatures");
        require(!transfers[nonce].processed, "Transfer already processed");
        
        // Verify validator signatures
        uint256 validSignatures = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < signatures.length; i++) {
            address signer = recoverSigner(
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(nonce, recipient, amount)),
                signatures[i]
            );
            
            if (validators[signer]) {
                validSignatures++;
            }
        }
        
        require(validSignatures >= REQUIRED_SIGNATURES, "Invalid signatures");
        
        // Mint tokens to recipient
        IERC20(tokenContract).mint(recipient, amount);
        
        transfers[nonce].processed = true;
        emit TransferCompleted(nonce, recipient, amount);
    }
}
```

=== Bridge Security Model

==== Multi-Signature Validation

*Signature Verification Process*:
1. Transfer request submitted on source chain
2. Validators monitor source chain for bridge events
3. Each validator independently verifies transfer legitimacy
4. Validators sign transfer approval using their private keys
5. Minimum 5/9 validator signatures required for execution
6. Destination chain contract verifies signatures before minting

*Cryptographic Security*:
- Ed25519 signatures for Solana operations
- ECDSA signatures for Ethereum-compatible chains
- BLS signature aggregation for efficiency (future upgrade)
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration for validator keys

==== Economic Security Measures

*Stake-Based Security*:
- Total validator stake: 900,000 SVMAI (minimum)
- Bridge TVL protection ratio: 1:10 (stake to locked value)
- Slashing mechanisms for malicious behavior
- Insurance fund for bridge failures (5% of bridge fees)

*Attack Cost Analysis*:
```
Bridge Attack Scenarios:
├── 51% Validator Compromise: Cost >450,000 SVMAI (~\\$2.25M at \\$5/SVMAI)
├── Smart Contract Exploit: Protected by formal verification and audits
├── Validator Key Compromise: Individual validator impact limited to 11%
└── Economic Attack: Profitable attack requires >\\$10M investment
```

=== Bridge Operations and User Experience

==== Transfer Process Flow

*User-Initiated Bridge Transfer*:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant SourceChain as Source Chain
    participant Validators as Validator Network
    participant DestChain as Destination Chain
    
    User->>SourceChain: Initiate bridge transfer
    SourceChain->>SourceChain: Lock tokens in bridge vault
    SourceChain->>Validators: Emit bridge event
    
    loop Validator Consensus
        Validators->>Validators: Verify transfer legitimacy
        Validators->>Validators: Sign transfer approval
    end
    
    Validators->>DestChain: Submit aggregated signatures
    DestChain->>DestChain: Verify signatures (5/9 threshold)
    DestChain->>DestChain: Mint tokens to user
    DestChain->>User: Transfer completed
```

==== Bridge Fee Optimization

*Dynamic Fee Structure*:
- Base fee: 0.1% of transfer amount
- Network congestion multiplier: 1x-3x based on pending transfers
- Fast track option: 2x fee for priority processing
- Bulk transfer discounts: Up to 50% reduction for transfers >\$10,000

*Fee Distribution*:
```
Bridge Fee Allocation:
├── Validator Rewards: 60%
├── Protocol Treasury: 25%
├── Insurance Fund: 10%
└── Development Fund: 5%
```

= Background and Related Work

== Autonomous Economic Agents

Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs) represent a paradigm shift in AI system design, combining artificial intelligence with economic reasoning capabilities \@fetch-aea-framework. The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol framework provides standardized communication mechanisms enabling autonomous agents to discover, negotiate, and transact with one another \@agent-to-agent-protocol.

Current implementations of autonomous agents primarily rely on centralized coordination mechanisms, creating bottlenecks and single points of failure. Our work extends this foundation by providing decentralized infrastructure specifically designed for agent discovery and economic coordination.

== Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how AI applications connect to external data sources and tools \@mcp-specification. MCP servers provide resources, tools, and prompts that enhance AI capabilities, but existing discovery mechanisms are fragmented and lack standardization.

Previous attempts at MCP server registries have been limited to centralized catalogs without economic incentives or verification mechanisms. AEAMCP introduces the first blockchain-based MCP server registry with comprehensive verification and economic coordination.

== Blockchain Infrastructure for AI

Blockchain platforms have been explored for AI coordination, with most work focusing on Ethereum-based solutions \@blockchain-ai-survey. However, Ethereum's high transaction costs and limited throughput make it unsuitable for high-frequency agent discovery operations.

Solana's unique architecture, featuring parallel transaction processing and low fees, provides an ideal foundation for AI agent infrastructure \@solana-whitepaper. Our system leverages Solana's Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) and event-driven architecture to create efficient, secure agent registries.

== Decentralized Identity and Reputation

Existing decentralized identity solutions \@did-specification often lack domain-specific reputation mechanisms required for AI agent ecosystems. Our approach integrates reputation tracking with economic staking, creating incentive-aligned verification systems.

= System Architecture

== Overview

AEAMCP consists of interconnected smart contracts (programs) on Solana blockchain, frontend applications, and off-chain indexing infrastructure. The architecture follows a hybrid approach: essential data stored on-chain for security and consensus, while detailed metadata resides off-chain for scalability.

== Core Components

=== Registry Programs

The system consists of two primary smart contracts:

*Agent Registry Program*: Manages `AgentRegistryEntryV1` accounts containing agent metadata, capabilities, service endpoints, and economic parameters. Each agent entry is stored in a Program Derived Address (PDA) calculated from the agent ID, owner authority, and program ID, ensuring unique, secure, and discoverable addresses.

*MCP Server Registry Program*: Manages `McpServerRegistryEntryV1` accounts for MCP servers, storing server capabilities, tool definitions, resource patterns, and service endpoints. Similar PDA derivation ensures secure ownership and discoverability.

=== Data Model

Our hybrid data model balances on-chain security with off-chain scalability:

*On-chain Data*:
- Core identification (agent/server ID, name, version)
- Service endpoints and capabilities flags
- Economic parameters (staking amounts, fees)
- Reputation metrics and status
- Verification hashes for off-chain content

*Off-chain Data*:
- Detailed capability descriptions
- Comprehensive tool/resource schemas
- Extended metadata and documentation
- Historical performance data

=== Program Derived Addresses

PDAs provide deterministic, secure account addresses without requiring private keys. Our PDA derivation follows the pattern:

```rust
// Agent Registry PDA
let (agent_pda, bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[
        AGENT_REGISTRY_PDA_SEED,  // "agent_reg_v1"
        agent_id.as_bytes(),
        owner_authority.as_ref(),
    ],
    &agent_registry_program_id,
);

// MCP Server Registry PDA  
let (server_pda, bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[
        MCP_SERVER_REGISTRY_PDA_SEED,  // "mcp_srv_reg_v1"
        server_id.as_bytes(),
        owner_authority.as_ref(),
    ],
    &mcp_server_registry_program_id,
);
```

This approach ensures that each owner can register exactly one entity per unique ID, preventing namespace conflicts while maintaining discoverability.

== Security Architecture

=== Access Control

The system implements multi-layered access control:

1. *Program Ownership*: Only the registry programs can modify registry entry accounts
2. *Signature Verification*: All modifications require valid signatures from the owner authority
3. *State Validation*: Comprehensive input validation and state consistency checks
4. *Reentrancy Protection*: Operation-in-progress flags prevent concurrent modifications

=== Data Integrity

*Hash Verification*: Off-chain content is verified using SHA-256 hashes stored on-chain
*Immutable History*: Registration timestamps and ownership records are preserved
*Rent Protection*: All accounts maintain rent exemption to prevent deletion

=== Economic Security

*Staking Requirements*: Higher verification tiers require token staking, creating economic commitment
*Fee-based Spam Prevention*: Registration fees prevent registry pollution
*Reputation Tracking*: On-chain reputation scores based on service completion and dispute resolution

= Implementation Details

== Smart Contract Implementation

The registry programs are implemented in Rust using the Solana native framework for maximum performance and minimal resource usage. Key implementation details include:

=== Registration Process

The agent registration process demonstrates the system's security and validation mechanisms:

```rust
pub fn process_register_agent(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    agent_data: RegisterAgentData,
) -> ProgramResult {
    // Account validation
    let accounts_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let agent_entry_info = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;
    let owner_authority_info = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;
    let payer_info = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;
    
    // Signature verification
    if !owner_authority_info.is_signer {
        return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
    }
    
    // PDA derivation and verification
    let (expected_pda, bump) = get_agent_pda_secure(
        &agent_data.agent_id,
        owner_authority_info.key,
        program_id,
    );
    
    if *agent*_entry_\_info_.key != expected_pda {
        return Err(RegistryError::InvalidPDA);
    }
    
    // Input validation
    validate_register_agent(&agent_data)?;
    
    // Account creation
    let space = AgentRegistryEntryV1::SPACE;
    let rent = Rent::get()?;
    let lamports = rent.minimum_balance(space);
    
    invoke(
        &system_instruction::create_account(
            payer_info.key,
            agent_entry_info.key,
            lamports,
            space as u64,
            program_id,
        ),
        &[payer_info.clone(), agent_entry_info.clone()],
    )?;
    
    // Data serialization
    let agent_entry = AgentRegistryEntryV1::new(
        bump,
        *owner*_authority_\_info_.key,
        agent_data,
        get_current_timestamp()?,
    );
    
    let mut data = agent_entry_info.try_borrow_mut_data()?;
    agent_entry.serialize(&mut &mut data[..])?;
    
    // Event emission
    emit_agent_registered_event(&agent_entry)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

=== State Management

Agent and server entries utilize versioned state structures for forward compatibility:

```rust
#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct AgentRegistryEntryV1 {
    pub bump: u8,
    pub registry_version: u8,
    pub state_version: u64,
    pub operation_in_progress: bool,
    pub owner_authority: Pubkey,
    pub agent_id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub agent_version: String,
    pub service_endpoints: Vec<ServiceEndpoint>,
    pub capabilities_flags: u64,
    pub skills: Vec<AgentSkill>,
    pub status: u8,
    pub registration_timestamp: i64,
    pub last_update_timestamp: i64,
    // Economic fields
    pub stake_amount: u64,
    pub staking_tier: u8,
    pub reputation_score: u64,
    pub total_earnings: u64,
    pub services_completed: u32,
    // Metadata
    pub extended_metadata_uri: Option<String>,
    pub tags: Vec<String>,
}
```

== Frontend Integration

The frontend implementation provides intuitive interfaces for registry interaction through React components and custom hooks:

=== Wallet Integration

```typescript
// Wallet provider setup
export function WalletProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet;
  const endpoint = useMemo(() => clusterApiUrl(network), [network]);
  
  const wallets = useMemo(
    () => [
      new PhantomWalletAdapter(),
      new SolflareWalletAdapter(),
      new TorusWalletAdapter(),
      new LedgerWalletAdapter(),
    ],
    []
  );

  return (
    <ConnectionProvider> endpoint={endpoint}>
      <SolanaWalletProvider> wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
        <WalletModalProvider>
          {children}
        </WalletModalProvider>
      </SolanaWalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
  );
}
```

=== Registry Service Integration

```typescript
// Agent registration with token payment
async function registerAgentWithToken(
  agentData: AgentRegistrationData,
  walletPublicKey: PublicKey
): Promise<Transaction> {
  const transaction = new Transaction();
  
  // Calculate PDA addresses
  const [agentPDA] = getAgentPDA(agentData.agentId, walletPublicKey);
  const [vaultPDA] = getAgentRegistryVaultPDA();
  
  // Token transfer instruction
  const transferInstruction = createTransferInstruction(
    userTokenAccount,
    vaultTokenAccount,
    walletPublicKey,
    REGISTRATION_FEE_LAMPORTS
  );
  
  // Registry instruction
  const registrationInstruction = new TransactionInstruction({
    keys: [
      { pubkey: agentPDA, isSigner: false, isWritable: true },
      { pubkey: walletPublicKey, isSigner: true, isWritable: true },
      // ... additional accounts
    ],
    programId: AGENT_REGISTRY_PROGRAM_ID,
    data: serializeAgentData(agentData),
  });
  
  transaction.add(transferInstruction, registrationInstruction);
  return transaction;
}
```

== Event System

The event system enables real-time updates and off-chain indexing:

```rust
// Event emission
#[event]
pub struct AgentRegistered {
    pub agent_id: String,
    pub owner_authority: Pubkey,
    pub agent_pda: Pubkey,
    pub name: String,
    pub service_endpoints: Vec<ServiceEndpoint>,
    pub capabilities_flags: u64,
    pub registration_timestamp: i64,
}

pub fn emit_agent_registered_event(
    agent_entry: &AgentRegistryEntryV1
) -> ProgramResult {
    emit!(AgentRegistered {
        agent_id: agent_entry.agent_id.clone(),
        owner_authority: agent_entry.owner_authority,
        agent_pda: /* derived PDA */,
        name: agent_entry.name.clone(),
        service_endpoints: agent_entry.service_endpoints.clone(),
        capabilities_flags: agent_entry.capabilities_flags,
        registration_timestamp: agent_entry.registration_timestamp,
    });
    Ok(())
}
```

= Economic Model and Tokenomics

== A2AMPL Token Design

The A2AMPL (Agentic Economy Amplifier Token), branded as SVMAI in user interfaces, serves as the native utility token of the AEAMCP ecosystem. The token design balances economic incentives with system security and growth.

=== Token Specifications

- *Total Supply*: 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) tokens
- *Decimals*: 9 (following Solana SPL Token standard)
- *Token Standard*: SPL Token on Solana blockchain
- *Mint Address*: `Cpzvdx6pppc9TNArsqgShCsKC9NCCjA2gtzHvUpump` (Mainnet)

=== Utility Functions

*Registration Fees*:
- Agent Registration: 100 A2AMPL tokens
- MCP Server Registration: 50 A2AMPL tokens

These fees serve multiple purposes:
1. Spam prevention through economic barrier
2. Value capture for protocol sustainability  
3. Quality signal through economic commitment

*Staking for Verification*:
The system implements tiered staking requirements for enhanced verification:

- Bronze Tier: 1,000 A2AMPL (Basic verification)
- Silver Tier: 10,000 A2AMPL (Enhanced visibility)  
- Gold Tier: 50,000 A2AMPL (Priority placement)
- Platinum Tier: 100,000 A2AMPL (Premium features)

Higher tiers unlock:
- Enhanced search visibility
- Reduced service fees
- Access to premium features
- Higher reputation weights

=== Economic Mechanisms

*Fee Distribution*:
Registration fees are distributed according to the following model:
- 40% - Protocol development fund
- 30% - Validator rewards and infrastructure
- 20% - Token buyback and burn mechanism
- 10% - Community governance treasury

*Staking Incentives*:
Staked tokens generate yields through:
- Service fee sharing (proportional to stake)
- Governance participation rewards
- Quality verification bonuses

*Service Payments*:
Future implementations will enable A2AMPL-denominated service payments between agents and from clients to service providers, creating a comprehensive economic ecosystem.

== Market Dynamics

=== Supply Mechanisms

The token supply follows a controlled inflation model:
- Initial mint: 1 billion tokens
- Mint authority transferred to governance
- Maximum annual inflation: 2% (subject to governance)
- Inflation allocated to: staking rewards (60%), development (25%), ecosystem growth (15%)

=== Demand Drivers

Token demand is driven by:
1. Registration requirements for new market participants
2. Staking for verification tiers and enhanced features
3. Service payments within the agent economy
4. Governance participation in protocol decisions

=== Price Stability Mechanisms

*Buyback and Burn*: Protocol fees fund token buybacks during market downturns, reducing supply and supporting price stability.

*Adaptive Fee Structure*: Registration fees adjust based on token price volatility, maintaining consistent USD-equivalent barriers while preserving tokenomics.

*Staking Lock-ups*: Verification staking includes time locks (30-365 days based on tier), reducing circulating supply and creating price support.

= Security Analysis

== Comprehensive Security Framework

        return Err(RegistryError::OperationInProgress);
    }
    self.operation_in_progress = true;
    Ok(())
}
```

*PDA Manipulation*:
Secure PDA derivation including owner authority:
```rust
pub fn get_agent_pda_secure(
    agent_id: &str,
    owner: &Pubkey,
    program_id: &Pubkey
) -> (Pubkey, u8) {
    Pubkey::find_program_address(
        &[
            AGENT_REGISTRY_PDA_SEED,
            agent_id.as_bytes(),
            owner.as_ref(),  // Prevents collision attacks
        ],
        program_id,
    )
}
```

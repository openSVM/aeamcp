\begin{abstract}
The emergence of autonomous economic agents and large language model (LLM) applications has created an urgent need for decentralized discovery and verification infrastructure that can operate at scale while maintaining security and economic sustainability. This comprehensive paper presents the Autonomous Economic Agent Model Context Protocol (AEAMCP), an on-chain registry system built on the Solana blockchain that enables secure, scalable, and economically incentivized registration of AI agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

Our system introduces novel mechanisms for agent verification, reputation tracking, and economic interactions through a sophisticated dual-token model (\textbf{AEA}/\textbf{SVMAI}), comprehensive security architecture with multiple audit cycles\footnote{Detailed audit reports available at: \url{https://github.com/openSVM/aeamcp/tree/main/docs/audits}}, and native Solana optimization. The implementation features hybrid data storage optimization, event-driven architecture, Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for deterministic account management, and comprehensive security measures achieving industry-standard protocol compliance with A2A, AEA, and MCP specifications.

Through extensive performance evaluation, security auditing, real-world deployment analysis, and rigorous mathematical modeling, we demonstrate the system's ability to handle high-throughput discovery operations while maintaining decentralization and economic sustainability. The paper provides detailed technical specifications, comprehensive security analysis, economic modeling with formal proofs, deployment architecture, SDK implementation, and future roadmap that establishes AEAMCP as foundational infrastructure for the emerging autonomous agent economy.

Key innovations include: (1) Novel hybrid data architecture optimizing for both on-chain security and off-chain scalability, (2) Dual-tokenomics model enabling sustainable economic incentives with mathematical proofs of stability, (3) Native Solana integration leveraging the network's unique capabilities, (4) Comprehensive security framework with automated auditing and formal verification, (5) Event-driven real-time updates and notifications, (6) Modular SDK design for rapid integration, (7) Deployment with demonstrated performance metrics, and (8) Rigorous game-theoretical analysis proving economic sustainability and anti-Sybil resistance.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Rise of Autonomous Economic Agents}

The convergence of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and economic systems has catalyzed the emergence of autonomous economic agents capable of independent decision-making, value creation, and economic interactions without direct human intervention. These AI entities represent a paradigm shift from traditional software applications to intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, plan, and act within complex economic environments.

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, and Llama have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation. When augmented with tools, memory, and economic incentives, these models transform into autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks, engaging in economic transactions, and providing specialized services across diverse domains.

Simultaneously, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized framework enabling AI systems to access external tools, resources, and prompts in a secure and interoperable manner. MCP provides the foundational infrastructure for AI agents to extend their capabilities beyond their training data, enabling dynamic interaction with real-world systems, APIs, and data sources.

\subsection{The AEAMCP Solution}

This paper presents the Autonomous Economic Agent Model Context Protocol (AEAMCP), a comprehensive solution that addresses fundamental challenges through a novel decentralized registry system built on the Solana blockchain. AEAMCP provides the foundational infrastructure for discovering, verifying, and economically coordinating autonomous agents and MCP servers in a fully decentralized manner.

\section{Economic Model and Tokenomics}

\subsection{Dual-Token Economic Architecture}

The AEAMCP ecosystem implements a sophisticated dual-token model designed to optimize different economic functions while maintaining sustainable incentive alignment across all stakeholders. This approach addresses the fundamental challenges of tokenomics by separating utility functions across specialized tokens designed for the Solana ecosystem.

\subsection{Token Overview}

\subsubsection{AEA (Autonomous Economic Agent) - Primary Utility Token}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Symbol}: AEA
\item \textbf{Name}: Autonomous Economic Agent
\item \textbf{Primary Functions}: Service payments, fee settlements, micro-transactions, agent interactions
\item \textbf{Total Supply}: 10,000,000,000 AEA (10 billion)
\item \textbf{Inflation Model}: Moderate inflation (2-4\% annually) to encourage circulation and ecosystem growth
\item \textbf{Network}: Solana SPL Token
\end{itemize}

The AEA token serves as the primary utility token for all economic transactions within the AEAMCP ecosystem. It is specifically designed to facilitate high-frequency, low-value transactions that are essential for autonomous agent operations. The token's economic model prioritizes liquidity and velocity, ensuring that agents can efficiently conduct business without significant transaction costs or delays.

\textbf{Key Utility Functions of AEA:}

1. \textbf{Service Payments}: AEA tokens are used for direct payments between clients and AI agents for services rendered. This includes both one-time payments for specific tasks and ongoing subscription-based services.

2. \textbf{Platform Fees}: All platform operations require AEA tokens for fees, including agent registration, transaction processing, and premium feature access.

3. \textbf{Micro-transactions}: The token enables efficient micro-payments for API calls, resource access, and small-scale computational tasks.

4. \textbf{Economic Incentives}: AEA tokens are distributed as rewards for ecosystem participation, including referral bonuses, bug bounties, and performance incentives.

\subsubsection{SVMAI (SVM Artificial Intelligence) - Governance Token}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Symbol}: SVMAI
\item \textbf{Name}: SVM Artificial Intelligence
\item \textbf{Primary Functions}: Governance voting, staking, long-term value accrual, premium features
\item \textbf{Total Supply}: 100,000,000 SVMAI (100 million)
\item \textbf{Inflation Model}: Deflationary with burn mechanisms to increase scarcity
\item \textbf{Network}: Solana SPL Token
\end{itemize}

The SVMAI token functions as the governance token for the AEAMCP ecosystem, designed to capture long-term value and provide holders with decision-making power over the platform's evolution. Unlike the utility-focused AEA token, SVMAI is designed for holding and staking, creating a stable foundation for ecosystem governance.

\textbf{Key Governance Functions of SVMAI:}

1. \textbf{Protocol Governance}: SVMAI holders vote on critical protocol parameters, including fee structures, tokenomics adjustments, and feature implementations.

2. \textbf{Staking and Reputation}: Agents and service providers can stake SVMAI tokens to enhance their reputation and visibility within the ecosystem.

3. \textbf{Premium Access}: Higher-tier features and priority access to new capabilities are gated behind SVMAI token holdings.

4. \textbf{Revenue Sharing}: A portion of platform revenues is distributed to SVMAI stakers as rewards, creating alignment between token holders and platform success.

\subsection{Economic Principles and Design Philosophy}

The dual-token model addresses several fundamental economic challenges in blockchain ecosystems operating on Solana:

\subsubsection{The Velocity Problem}

Single-token systems often suffer from the "velocity problem" where tokens used for transactions are immediately sold, preventing value accrual. Our Solana-native solution addresses this through:

\textbf{High-Velocity Token (AEA)}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimized for frequent transactions and service payments within the Solana ecosystem
\item Lower individual value enables micro-payments leveraging Solana's low fees
\item Inflation encourages spending rather than hoarding
\item Large supply prevents price volatility from small transactions
\item Integration with Solana's native features for efficient transfers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Low-Velocity Token (SVMAI)}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Incentivizes long-term holding through staking rewards on Solana
\item Governance rights create ongoing utility beyond speculation
\item Deflationary mechanisms increase scarcity over time
\item Limited supply creates premium positioning
\item Leverages Solana's staking infrastructure for secure delegation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Token Distribution and Allocation}

\subsubsection{AEA Distribution}

\begin{verbatim}
Total Supply: 10,000,000,000 AEA
|-- Public Sale: 3,000,000,000 (30%)
|-- Ecosystem Incentives: 2,500,000,000 (25%)
|-- Development Team: 1,500,000,000 (15%)
|-- Platform Treasury: 1,500,000,000 (15%)
|-- Strategic Partners: 1,000,000,000 (10%)
+-- Liquidity Provision: 500,000,000 (5%)
\end{verbatim}

The AEA token distribution is designed to ensure broad ecosystem participation while maintaining sufficient reserves for long-term development and ecosystem growth. The allocation prioritizes community participation and ecosystem development over concentrated ownership.

\subsubsection{SVMAI Distribution}

\begin{verbatim}
Total Supply: 100,000,000 SVMAI
|-- Public Sale: 30,000,000 (30%)
|-- Staking Rewards: 25,000,000 (25%)
|-- Development Team: 15,000,000 (15%)
|-- Governance Treasury: 15,000,000 (15%)
|-- Strategic Partners: 10,000,000 (10%)
+-- Initial Liquidity: 5,000,000 (5%)
\end{verbatim}

The SVMAI distribution focuses on long-term sustainability and governance participation. A significant portion is allocated to staking rewards to incentivize long-term holding and network security.

\subsection{Staking Economics and Governance}

\subsubsection{Tier-Based Staking System}

The SVMAI staking system implements a tier-based approach that provides increasing benefits for larger stakes:

\begin{verbatim}
Bronze Tier: 100-999 SVMAI
|-- 5% APY staking rewards
|-- Basic agent features
+-- Standard support access

Silver Tier: 1,000-9,999 SVMAI
|-- 8% APY staking rewards
|-- Enhanced discovery algorithms
|-- Priority support
+-- Advanced analytics

Gold Tier: 10,000-99,999 SVMAI
|-- 12% APY staking rewards
|-- Premium positioning in search
|-- Dedicated account management
|-- Beta feature access
+-- Governance voting weight: 1.5x

Platinum Tier: 100,000+ SVMAI
|-- 15% APY staking rewards
|-- Maximum discovery prioritization
|-- White-glove support services
|-- Product development influence
+-- Governance voting weight: 2x
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Governance Mechanisms}

The SVMAI governance system implements on-chain voting for all major protocol decisions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Proposal Submission}: Requires minimum 1,000 SVMAI stake to submit proposals
\item \textbf{Voting Period}: 7-day voting period for standard proposals, 14 days for critical changes
\item \textbf{Quorum Requirements}: Minimum 10\% of total supply must participate for validity
\item \textbf{Execution Delay}: 48-hour delay before approved proposals take effect
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Revenue Model and Sustainability}

\subsubsection{Platform Revenue Sources}

The AEAMCP platform generates revenue through multiple streams, all denominated in AEA tokens:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Transaction Fees}: 0.1-0.5\% of transaction value for all agent service payments
\item \textbf{Registration Fees}: Flat fee in AEA for agent and MCP server registration
\item \textbf{Premium Features}: Monthly subscription fees for enhanced capabilities
\item \textbf{Marketplace Commissions}: 2-5\% commission on service marketplace transactions
\item \textbf{Data Services}: Fees for advanced analytics and market intelligence
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Revenue Distribution}

Platform revenues are distributed according to the following allocation:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SVMAI Stakers}: 40\% of revenues distributed as staking rewards
\item \textbf{Development Fund}: 30\% allocated to ongoing platform development
\item \textbf{Ecosystem Growth}: 20\% for marketing, partnerships, and user acquisition
\item \textbf{Community Treasury}: 10\% for grants, hackathons, and community initiatives
\end{itemize}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

\subsection{Economic Sustainability Proofs}

This section provides formal mathematical proofs of the economic sustainability properties of the AEAMCP system.

\subsubsection{Token Velocity Optimization}

The dual-token system optimizes for different velocity characteristics:

\textbf{Utility Function}:
\begin{equation}
U = \alpha \cdot V_A^{-1} + \beta \cdot V_S^{-1}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $V_A$ = velocity of AEA tokens
\item $V_S$ = velocity of SVMAI tokens
\item $\alpha, \beta$ = preference parameters
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nash Equilibrium Analysis}

The staking game reaches Nash equilibrium when:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \pi_i}{\partial s_i} = 0 \quad \forall i \in N
\end{equation}

Where $\pi_i$ represents the payoff function for agent $i$ and $s_i$ is their staking amount.

\subsection{Anti-Sybil Resistance}

The system prevents Sybil attacks through economic barriers:

\begin{equation}
C_{attack}(k) > B_{attack}(k) \quad \forall k \geq 1
\end{equation}

This ensures that the cost of mounting a Sybil attack always exceeds the potential benefits.

\section{Performance Evaluation}

### 2. Execute Devnet Deployment
```bash
# Build all programs
./scripts/build.sh

# Deploy with token integration
./scripts/deploy-devnet-with-token.sh

# Validate deployment
node test-token-integration.js
```

### 3. Frontend Integration Testing
- Test agent registration flow end-to-end
- Test MCP server registration flow
- Validate token balance updates
- Test error scenarios (insufficient balance, etc.)

### 4. Performance & UX Optimization

- Add loading states and progress indicators
- Implement better error messages
- Add transaction success/failure feedback

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 100% program deployment success rate
- [ ] < 2 seconds average transaction confirmation
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] 100% frontend test coverage for token flows

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] < 5 seconds token balance loading time

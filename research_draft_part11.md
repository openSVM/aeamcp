   ```
   +-------------------+     +-------------------+
   |                   |     |                   |
   | Agent Registry    |---->| DID Document      |
   | Entry             |     |                   |
   |                   |     | - Verification    |
   | - agent_id        |     |   Methods         |
   | - owner_authority |     | - Service         |
   | - did_reference   |---->|   Endpoints       |
